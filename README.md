# LeaseShield App

## Business Plan & Project Overview

LeaseShield App is a subscription-based SaaS platform designed specifically for small and midsize landlords (1–100 units) who need simple, state-specific, risk-focused guidance to operate legally and confidently. The platform offers attorney-backed templates, curated compliance updates, fillable forms, and clear workflows that replace uncertainty with protection.

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Value Proposition:** LeaseShield takes landlords from lost to confident by protecting them from financial and legal risks.

**Pricing:** $10/month or $100/year with a 7-day free trial

**Target Audience:** Independent landlords managing 1–100 rental units

**Differentiator:** A "protective mentor" that filters out noise and only delivers what truly matters — not a generic all-in-one tool.

---

## Problem Statement

Landlords repeatedly express several universal frustrations:

- **Outdated templates** found through Google searches or inherited from other landlords
- **Attorney costs** ($200–$500/hr) just to update leases or review adverse action decisions
- **Fear of accidental violations** (Fair Housing, source-of-income rules, ESA laws, new disclosure requirements)
- **Confusion about screening** — how to read credit reports, which criminal indicators matter, and how to follow adverse action laws
- **Overwhelming compliance updates** from associations: too much, too legalistic, often irrelevant

**What Landlords Want:**
- Simple, state-specific, fillable templates
- Updates that only include meaningful changes
- A clear explanation of why a clause must change
- Confidence that they are not one mistake away from a lawsuit

## Market Opportunity

### Competitive Landscape

1. **Free generic templates** (Google, Zillow, eForms) — Easy but NOT state-specific; high liability
2. **All-in-one DIY landlord software** (TurboTenant, Avail, RentRedi) — Templates exist but not deeply curated
3. **Template/form sites** (ezLandlordForms, Rocket Lawyer) — Solid but expensive or overly legalistic
4. **Associations** (state/local chapters) — Deep knowledge but overwhelming volumes

### LeaseShield's Unique Position

**No competitor offers:**
- A curated "only what matters" update philosophy
- State-specific templates plus practical risk explanations
- A friendly, protective tone (not legalese)
- AI-powered screening helpers
- Built-in screening upsell (Western Verify)
