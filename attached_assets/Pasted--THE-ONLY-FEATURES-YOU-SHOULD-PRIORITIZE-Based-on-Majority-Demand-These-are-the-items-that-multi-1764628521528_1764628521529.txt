✅ THE ONLY FEATURES YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE (Based on Majority Demand)

These are the items that multiple respondents mentioned OR that clearly scored the highest on your ranked-choice questions.

Tier 1: Must-Build for MVP (Majority Wants These)

These are the backbone of LeaseShield. If you shipped ONLY these, you would still have a killer paid product.

1. State-Specific Leases + Notices (High demand across survey)

Everyone ranked these high.
These include:

Lease agreement

3-day notices

Late rent notices

Lease violation notices

Move-in / move-out checklists

💥 These are non-negotiable. Landlords expect them.

2. Simple Compliance Tools (Very strong interest)

Landlords strongly value:

Adverse action letter templates

A “steps to screen legally” checklist

Required disclosures & handouts by state

These reduce liability — HUGE value proposition.

3. Credit Report Decoder / Screening Guide (Extremely common pain point)

Multiple people commented about needing:

Help understanding credit

Help interpreting tenant screening results

What matters and what doesn’t

This is your superpower as Western Verify’s owner — massive advantage.

4. Monthly Legal/Regulation Updates (Multiple requests)

A few comments specifically said:

“Send legal updates that create liability.”

This becomes your sticky value — the reason people stay subscribed long-term.

5. A Centralized “Landlord Toolkit” Dashboard (Implied need across survey)

Landlords want everything in one easy place:

Docs

Letters

Checklists

Guides

This doesn’t need to be complicated — even a clean menu structure is enough at MVP.

🟡 Tier 2: High-Value, Moderately Requested (Build Next After MVP)

These were requested by more than one person, but not the majority.

6. Tenant Communication Templates

Things like:

Rent reminder messages

Welcome letter templates

Lease renewal wording

Lightweight and easy to add.

7. Maintenance / Repair Scheduling Guidance (moderate interest)

People asked for:

How to prioritize repairs

How to manage maintenance

Templates for notices

Not a “portal” — just guides + templates for now.

8. Rent Ledger Template / Basic Bookkeeping Help

Some landlords struggle with:

Tracking rent

Tracking expenses

BUT — this should remain simple PDF / spreadsheet templates early on.
