⚠️ What MUST be added (these are standard for landlords + legal)

You’re missing:

1. Category (Rent, Late Fee, Utility, Deposit, Other)

If you don’t have this, landlords can’t separate rent vs late fees vs NSF fees.

2. Description

Landlords often have:

“December Rent”

“Late Fee – 5 days late”

“Partial Payment”

3. Payment Method

Small landlords ALWAYS need this for documentation:

Cash

Check

Zelle

Venmo

ACH

Certified funds

4. Reference # or Check #

Extremely important if a tenant disputes payment.

5. Effective Date (different from transaction date)

Example:

Effective Date: 12/01/2025 (rent due)

Entry Date: 12/05/2025 (landlord entered payment)

6. Notes

Landlords constantly need to write:

“Tenant paid partial due to financial hardship”

“NSF—bank returned payment”

“Late fee waived”

7. Running Balance Should Calculate Automatically

You’re doing this—but make sure it updates based on entry order, not “Month”.

🔥 Recommended RENT LEDGER VERSION 2 (clean, simple, professional)

Here is EXACTLY what your spreadsheet should look like (and what your app should generate):

HEADER AREA (keep this — it’s good)
RENT LEDGER REPORT
Generated: 12/2/2025 2:34 PM
Tenant: Morgan Mower
Unit: (optional)
Lease Period: 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31

📌 LEDGER TABLE (use these columns)
Date	Effective Date	Type	Category	Description	Charge Amount	Payment Amount	Running Balance	Payment Method	Ref #	Notes
12/1/2025	12/1/2025	Charge	Rent	December Rent	$1,500.00	$0.00	$1,500.00	—	—	—
12/5/2025	12/1/2025	Payment	Rent	Payment for Dec Rent	$0.00	$1,500.00	$0.00	Zelle	TXN #9134	Paid in full
📊 SUMMARY SECTION (you should change this)

Your current summary is messy and missing useful totals.

Use this instead:

SUMMARY
Total Rent Charged: $1,500.00
Total Payments Received: $1,500.00
Outstanding Balance: $0.00
Status: Paid / Current


Clean, clear, useful.

🔥 WHAT I RECOMMEND YOU CHANGE RIGHT NOW (IMPORTANT)

Here is your exact to-do list:

1. Update your ledger columns to this:

Date

Effective Date

Type

Category

Description

Charge Amount

Payment Amount

Running Balance

Payment Method

Reference #

Notes

2. Remove “Month” — it’s confusing and unnecessary

Everything should be based on effective date, not “month”.

3. Fix the Summary section

Use:

Total Charges

Total Payments

Outstanding Balance

Status

4. Fix the duplicate rows in your example

You currently show the same $1,500 twice — this will confuse landlords.

5. Remove the random quotation marks ($1500.00")

That looks like a formatting bug.
