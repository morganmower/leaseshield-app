⚠️ What needs improvement (to make “Full Access” truly effective)

Based on what you currently have vs. what your survey data shows landlords want, there are 3 main areas where your copy falls short — and those gaps may be holding back throughput.

1. The feature language doesn’t match what the majority explicitly asked for

Your bullets list: “Compliance monitoring,” “Tenant issue workflows,” “AI credit report decoder,” “Document assembly wizard,” etc. — nice, but after reviewing your survey results, these are not the exact phrases landlords used.

Survey-supported demand was strongest for:

State-specific leases & notices (including late rent, eviction/violation, renewals)

Move-in / move-out checklists

Adverse action letters & compliance doc templates

Credit / background report decoding and interpretation help

Legal/regulation updates, especially for liability-creating regulation changes

Your site’s “compliance monitoring” or “tenant issue workflows” feels more like generic SaaS-speak — landlords don’t hear those in their own language. When the copy isn’t aligned, the connection fails.

Bottom line: To maximize conversions, the landing page must use exact user-language — the phrasing that triggers immediate recognition: “Yes — that’s exactly the pain I have.”

2. The “why pay now” / urgency / value-benefit isn’t explicit enough

The “Full Access — No Trial” message is fine, but doesn’t answer why a landlord should commit today instead of salting a few PDFs for free elsewhere. It lacks urgency and benefit framing.

Landlords need to hear:

“Avoid costly compliance mistakes.”

“Save dozens of hours you’d waste researching / drafting / printing.”

“Stay legally protected with up-to-date forms for your state.”

“Stop wasting time on confusing credit reports — get clear guidance right away.”

As is, the page mostly lists features, rather than selling the relief or selling the pain.

3. Some of the high-value, survey-backed features are missing from the bullets altogether

For example:

Move-in / move-out checklists — not mentioned.

Adverse-action letters / tenant-screening rejection letters — not explicit.

Monthly or ongoing legal/regulation updates (so landlords know they stay current) — missing.

Because these features drastically increase value to landlords (especially small ones), omitting them downplays the strength of LeaseShield and hurts perceived value.
