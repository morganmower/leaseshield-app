1️⃣ Add a single “orientation sentence” at the very start

Problem:
First-time applicants (and older landlords reviewing it) don’t always understand what this application is vs what screening is.

Solution (1 sentence, top of page):

This application collects basic information needed to evaluate your rental request. All applications are reviewed using the same screening criteria.

Why this matters:

Sets fairness expectations

Reduces applicant anxiety

Protects the landlord

Costs you nothing

2️⃣ Label “Optional” fields more explicitly

Problem:
Applicants assume everything is required → frustration → abandonment.

Solution:
Any non-essential field should visibly say:

(Optional)

Especially for:

additional comments

secondary phone numbers

vehicle info

emergency contact info (if present)

This alone can reduce drop-off significantly.

3️⃣ Criminal / eviction questions: timing & phrasing check

If you are currently asking:

about criminal history

about prior evictions

before screening authorization

⚠️ That’s a risk zone, depending on state.

Safe framing (if questions exist):

Instead of:

“Have you ever been convicted…”

Use:

“Information you provide may be verified through a background screening process.”

And do not require narrative explanations in the application itself.

Key rule:
👉 Explanation belongs in the decoder phase, not the application.

4️⃣ Income & employment questions — neutral framing

Income questions are usually fine, but phrasing matters.

Good framing:

“Current monthly income (before taxes)”

Avoid:

value judgments

“must earn”

“minimum required”

Those belong in landlord criteria, not the application.

5️⃣ Authorization & consent section (this is important)

This should be:

visually distinct

near the end

clearly labeled

One small improvement: add this line above the checkbox:

By submitting this application, you authorize the verification of the information provided, including background and credit screening where permitted by law.

This:

ties consent to action

avoids legal jargon

reinforces transparency

Also ensure you capture:

timestamp

IP

applicant name as typed

(You likely already do — just confirming.)

6️⃣ Final submit confirmation (small UX win)

After submission, show a calming confirmation, not just “submitted.”

Example:

Application submitted successfully
The property manager will review your application using their standard screening criteria. You’ll be contacted if additional information is needed.

This reduces follow-up emails and anxiety.

What I don’t recommend adding

To keep this lightweight and safe:

❌ No scoring
❌ No “likelihood” language
❌ No conditional logic that hides questions per applicant
❌ No explanations of criminal/credit items inside the application
❌ No state-specific legal explanations here (belongs in decoders)

The big picture (important reassurance)

Your application:

is already compliant-leaning

doesn’t overstep

doesn’t decide anything

and fits perfectly with your decoder model

What we’re doing now is polish and risk-reduction, not redesign.
