1. It does NOT directly reflect the top survey-demand features

Your feature bullets say:

State-specific lease templates

Compliance monitoring

Tenant issue workflows

AI credit report decoder

Document assembly wizard

24/7 AI chat assistant

These are good — but they DO NOT match the exact language your landlords used.

Survey respondents specifically valued:

State-specific leases & notices

Move-in/move-out checklists

Adverse action letters

Screening steps checklist

Credit report interpretation help

Legal/regulation updates

Your pricing block should reflect the majority-demand wording because that’s what triggers the “Oh wow, they built EXACTLY what I need” moment.

❗ 2. The “Full Access” pitch needs a stronger WHY NOW or What you get instantly

Right now the headline is:

Full Access — No Trial Needed
Get instant access to all LeaseShield features.

This is good, but it’s generic.

Landlords don’t buy generic.

They buy pain relief.

Your headline should hit:

Legal safety

Simplicity

Time savings

No more guessing

No more Googling forms

That’s the emotional jet fuel that increases throughput.
