1️⃣ “SIMPLE WORKFLOW / How It Works”
❌ What’s wrong now

“SIMPLE WORKFLOW” is tiny → looks like a label

“How It Works” is correct, but underpowered

Supporting line is too light → fades away

Steps feel informational, not authoritative

✅ What it should feel like

“Here’s the core system. This is how the platform works.”

🔧 EXACT FIX
Eyebrow (keep, but upgrade)

From application to screening to compliant documents — all in one connected process.

Margin-bottom: 48px

Step layout tweaks (important)

Keep your step copy, but:

Increase vertical spacing between steps (32–40px)

Make step numbers more visually distinct:

Color: brand green

Font-weight: 700

Step titles at 18–19px, not body size

Descriptions at 16px, normal weight

This prevents the “instruction manual” look.

2️⃣ “Built by professionals…” (THIS IS NOT A FOOTNOTE)
❌ Why it looks legal now

Small font

Single line

No section framing

Buried between bigger sections

✅ What it should feel like

“You’re in experienced hands.”

🔧 EXACT FIX

Turn this into a Trust Band, not a sentence.

Structure

Wrap it in a container with:

Background: #F8FAFC

Padding: 48px top / bottom

Text centered

Text (rewrite slightly but same meaning)

Heading

Built by Screening & Compliance Professionals


Font size: 24–26px

Font weight: 600

Color: #0F172A

Margin-bottom: 12px

Supporting text

Decades of hands-on experience helping landlords interpret screening results and stay compliant.


Font size: 16–17px

Color: #475569

Max-width: 640px

Centered

This instantly removes the “legal disclaimer” feel.

3️⃣ “Designed to complement your apartment association membership”

This one is especially important — and yes, right now it absolutely looks like legal fine print.

❌ What’s wrong

Too small

Reads like a caveat

No visual emphasis

Sits naked on white background

✅ What it should feel like

“This works with what you already trust — not against it.”

🔧 EXACT FIX
Give it its own Context Section

NOT A REPLACEMENT — A COMPLEMENT

Margin-bottom: 16px

Body text

Associations provide education and advocacy.  
LeaseShield provides day-to-day execution — interpreting screening results, managing compliance workflows, and generating current documents.


Font size: 16–17px

Color: #475569

Line height: 1.6

Max-width: 720px

Optional (strong but calm closer)
Most landlords use both — and that’s exactly how LeaseShield was designed.


Italic or slightly lighter weight.

4️⃣ Global Fix: Subtitle Consistency (THIS IS KEY)

Right now:

“Start Here”

“Beyond Screening”

“Simple Workflow”

“Built by professionals”

All feel like different visual systems.

Rule to enforce everywhere:

Eyebrows: 14–15px, uppercase, letter-spaced

Section headers: 26–36px, bold

Supporting text: 16–18px

If something matters → it CANNOT be tiny.

FINAL VERDICT (no fluff)

You’re not wrong — your instincts are excellent.

Nothing looks “cheap” because of color or branding.
It looks cheap because important ideas are being visually whispered.

Once you:

Increase section authority

Add breathing room

Stop using small text for strategic messaging

…the site will feel:

confident

intentional

premium

trustworthy
