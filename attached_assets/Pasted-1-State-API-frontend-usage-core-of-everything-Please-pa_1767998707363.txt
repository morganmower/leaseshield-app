1) State API + frontend usage (core of everything)

Please paste:

Backend

The full route handler for:

GET /api/states

Any service/helper it calls

Frontend

useStates() hook

One example component that used to have SUPPORTED_STATES and now uses the hook
(signup or add-property is perfect)

👉 This lets me verify:

single source of truth

caching

no hidden hardcoding

UI won’t break when you add state #16

2) Legislative monitoring endpoints (safety-critical)

Paste the full code for:

/api/admin/legislative-monitoring/run

/api/admin/legislative-monitoring/ingest

/api/admin/legislative-monitoring/publish

jobLock.ts

👉 I’m checking for:

approval gate enforcement

lock correctness

no accidental background publishing

correct default behavior

3) LegislativeMonitoringService methods

Paste only these methods (not the whole file):

ingestNow()

queueFromLatestIngest()

publishApproved()

👉 I will verify:

idempotency

deduping

approval-only publishing

correct status transitions

4) Database migrations related to states

Paste:

The migration that added:

Illinois

foreign keys on properties.state and rental_properties.state

Any data-cleanup SQL you ran before adding FK constraints

👉 This catches silent data corruption risks.

🟡 NICE-TO-HAVE (if you want a deeper review)
5) Template selection logic

Paste:

The API route that returns templates filtered by stateId

Any fallback logic (if state has no templates)

👉 I’ll check that IL can’t accidentally show UT docs.

6) Application state handling

Paste:

Where application disclosures or fields branch by state

👉 This ensures Illinois doesn’t miss required disclosures.

🟢 OPTIONAL (fast sanity check)

If pasting files is annoying, you can instead paste:

A Replit tree screenshot of:

server/

shared/schema.ts

client/src/hooks/

AND results of repo search for:

SUPPORTED_STATES

"UT"

"TX"

I can infer a lot just from that.

How to paste (fastest)

You can paste in chunks like this:

File: server/routes/states.ts

// code here


No formatting perfection needed.
