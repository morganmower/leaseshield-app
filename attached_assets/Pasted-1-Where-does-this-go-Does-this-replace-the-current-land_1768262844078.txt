1️⃣ Where does this go?
Does this replace the current landing page hero, or live elsewhere?
✅ Answer: Yes — this replaces the current public landing page hero.

Not post-login. Not buried. Not a separate page.

Why:

70–90% of your traffic arrives with a screening report problem

This is the first 2–4 seconds clarity moment

You are fixing the front door, not adding a new room

What happens to the current hero?

It doesn’t disappear — it gets demoted.

Structure recommendation:

[NEW Screening-first Hero]
[Two-card “Start Here”]
[Simple Diagram]
—————————————
[Existing hero content reframed as “What else LeaseShield does”]
[How It Works]
[Association differentiation]
[Trust signal]


Think of this as:

New Hero = “Why you’re here”

Old Hero = “What else you get”

This preserves all your work and fixes the entry problem.

2️⃣ “Explain My Screening Report” CTA — where does it go?

This is critical.

❌ What it should NOT do

❌ Not dump them on a generic dashboard

❌ Not make them choose “credit vs criminal vs eviction” immediately

❌ Not feel like they clicked the wrong thing

✅ Correct destination (best option)

A unified “Explain a Screening Report” entry screen
(even if it’s just a thin wrapper over existing tools)

Minimum viable version (no overbuild):

Route them to one page that does 3 things:

Page title:

Explain a Screening Report

Then immediately asks ONE question:

What would you like help understanding?

Options (big buttons):

Credit Report

Criminal Report

Eviction History

Each option routes to your existing decoder pages.

This preserves your current architecture but removes confusion.

⚠️ Why not send them directly to Credit Decoder?

Because they don’t know that’s what they need yet.

Remember your rule:

If a 6th grader has to think, you lost them.

This small “choice gate” builds confidence.

3️⃣ Two-card section — where does “Upload or connect” go?
✅ Answer: Do NOT create a new upload system yet.

That’s overbuilding.

Instead:

Card 1 (“Explain My Screening Report”) routes to:

➡️ The unified decoder entry screen (described above)

From there:

“Upload” uses your existing upload logic

“Connect” uses Western Verify integration

You reuse everything you already built

The label is doing the work — not a new feature.

Card 2 (“New Application + Screening”) routes to:

➡️ Your existing application flow

No changes needed here other than:

Clear expectation

Secondary visual weight

🧠 Big Picture Architecture (This Is the Key Insight)

You are NOT building new functionality.

You are building a confidence ramp.

Here’s the mental flow now:

Before (current):

“Here’s a platform. Figure out where you belong.”

After (new):

“You’re here to understand a report → click this → we’ll guide you.”

That’s the difference between:

Impressive software

Relief-driven product
