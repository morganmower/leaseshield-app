BACKGROUND SCREENING DISCLOSURE & ACKNOWLEDGMENT

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

As part of the rental application process, the landlord or property manager may request a background screening report about you for housing purposes.

If screening is requested:

You will receive a separate invitation directly from Western Verify, the consumer reporting agency, delivered through its screening platform DigitalDelve

That invitation will include a standalone disclosure and authorization, which you must review and complete before any consumer report is obtained

LeaseShield does not collect or store your Social Security number, date of birth, or screening authorization

The background screening report, if obtained, may include information permitted by law, such as credit history, rental history, employment-related information, criminal records, and eviction records.

ADVERSE ACTION NOTICE

If adverse action is taken based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you will be provided an adverse action notice that includes:

A statement that the consumer reporting agency did not make the decision and cannot explain why the decision was made
