Below is exact, copy-paste-ready empty-state text for each page, followed by clear rules for when each empty state should disappear (so you don’t annoy returning users).

1️⃣ Properties Page – Empty State (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
When this shows

User has 0 properties

Copy (use verbatim)

Headline:
Get Started

Body:
Add your first property to send applications, route screening through Western Verify, and access state-specific leases and notices.

Primary Button:
Add Your First Property

Secondary (optional link):
Why do I need a property?

Secondary link explanation (tooltip or small text):
Properties organize applications, screening, and documents by location.

When this empty state should disappear

Immediately after the first property is added

Never show again for this user

This one is purely onboarding.

2️⃣ Applications Page – Empty State
When this shows

User has 0 applications

Copy

Headline:
Start Your First Application

Body:
Send one link to the applicant. LeaseShield tracks the process while screening runs through Western Verify.

Primary Button:
Create Application Link

Secondary (optional):
See how it works (2 min)

When this empty state should disappear

After first application is created

Replace with normal list view even if list later becomes empty again

Why: Once they’ve done it once, they don’t need onboarding again.

3️⃣ Documents (Leases & Notices) Page – Empty State
When this shows

No saved/favorited documents
(or if documents are state-filtered and none match)

Copy

Headline:
Need a Lease or Notice?

Body:
Browse state-specific leases and notices updated when legislation changes.

Primary Button:
Browse Leases & Notices

Optional trust line (small text):
Documents are reviewed and updated as laws change.

When this empty state should disappear

Never fully disappears

Converts into:

Filter suggestions

“No documents match this state” messaging

This is not onboarding — it’s guidance.

4️⃣ Screening Decoder Page – Empty State
When this shows

No pasted/uploaded report yet

Copy

Headline:
Understand Screening Results Instantly

Body:
Paste or upload a screening report. LeaseShield explains what matters, what doesn’t, and what to ask next.

Primary Button:
Paste or Upload Report

Supporting line (small text):
Most landlords misinterpret at least one item on every screening report. This prevents that.

When this empty state should disappear

After first successful decode

After that, show:

Recent decodes

“Paste another report” inline

5️⃣ Dashboard – No Activity Yet (Optional but Powerful)
When this shows

User has:

Properties = 0

Applications = 0

No decoder usage

Copy

Headline:
Welcome to LeaseShield

Body:
LeaseShield helps you collect applications, route screening through Western Verify, understand risk, and use the right documents when laws change.

Primary Button:
Add Your First Property

Secondary Button:
Quick Tour (2 min)

When this empty state should disappear

As soon as any one of these happens:

Property added

Application created

Decoder used

After that, never show again.

Empty State Disappearance Rules (Simple Logic)
Page	Disappears After
Properties	First property added
Applications	First application created
Decoder	First decode completed
Dashboard intro	Any meaningful action
Documents	Never (contextual only)

This prevents:

Repetition

Annoyance

“I’ve seen this already” fatigue

Key Principle (Important)

Empty states should feel like:

“Helpful direction”

Not:

“You’re missing something”
“You did something wrong”
“You need to learn our app”

Your copy already aligns with this — don’t let it drift.
