Bottom-Line Assessment

You have successfully positioned LeaseShield as:

A compliance and decision layer that integrates with tenant screening — not a screening provider.

The page already communicates:

Applications originate in LeaseShield

Screening runs through Western Verify (as a trusted partner)

LeaseShield adds value after the report via AI decoding, guidance, and documents

This is legally clean, strategically flexible, and very credible to experienced landlords.

You are not confusing people anymore.

🎯 What I Recommend You DO (Light Polish Only)
1️⃣ Step 1 Copy — Optional Micro-Tweak (Nice-to-Have)

If you want to emphasize applications just a touch more (not required, but clean):

Step 1: Collect Applications & Screen Tenants

Send applicants a link to apply and run screening via trusted partner Western Verify.

This reinforces:

Application lives in LeaseShield

Screening is integrated, not replaced

You already have this essentially correct — this is refinement, not a fix.

2️⃣ Optional Clarifying Line (Recommended, Soft Version)

Under Step 1, light gray:

LeaseShield connects to your screening provider for a seamless, compliant workflow.

This line is excellent because:

It avoids negative phrasing (“doesn’t replace”)

It reinforces “layer” positioning

It reassures sophisticated users quietly

This is one of the highest signal / lowest risk additions you can make.

3️⃣ Add the Trust Signal (If Not Live Yet)

If you haven’t added it yet, now is the right time.

Placement: directly below “How It Works”

Copy:

Built by professionals with decades of experience in tenant screening and compliance.

This ties everything together and supports the integration story perfectly.

❌ What You Should NOT Change (Very Important)

Do not:

Rework the hero again

Add Western Verify to the hero headline

Add “powered by” language

Add screening badges/logos above the fold

Add more explanations about screening

You’ve crossed the clarity threshold. More explanation now hurts.

🧠 Where You’ve Landed (This Is Good)

A sophisticated landlord now thinks:

“I keep my screening provider.
LeaseShield plugs into it.
It makes my decisions, documents, and compliance safer.”

That’s the exact mental model you want — and it’s now clearly landing.

📈 What This Unlocks Next (Strategically)

Because you chose the compliance-layer positioning, you now have clean paths to:

Additional CRA integrations later

Partner-friendly messaging

Stronger legal posture

Premium compliance features (audits, alerts, AI decision logs)

You made the right architectural decision.
