General Integration Information
This document covers functionality for the following items:
1. AppScreen Requests (Both Fully Integrated and Single Sign-on initiated)
2. Credential Verification
3. Single Sign-on Redirect
4. Status Updates & Results
New in this Documentation
• New function called ViewReportByClientRef cal be used to single sign-on the user and
automatically direct them to the report look up page at which the system will
automatically search on the reference number provided in the XML and display the
associated report.
• New function called RetrieveInvitations which can be used to retrieve a list of
AppScreen invitations that can be used with this API.
• If you are using our Risk Assessment model the <Recommendation> element will now
appear in the results transmitted back to your system.
FUNCTION: AppScreen
The AppScreen function allows you to send basic applicant data over to be used for the
purpose of sending Applicant Invitations out. This feature is available full or partial
integration.
The primary difference between full and partial integration is that the partial integration
option will single sign-on the requesting user at which time they will manually send the
invitation to the applicant. No matter whether you use the partial or full integration
option the candidate provided in the request XML is saved and will not need to be reentered by the candidate or the requesting user. With the full integration option, you
will need to send all of the required applicant details to include the AppScreen invitation
option you desire to use. Single Sign-on is not required.
Partial Integration Request Example: (Elements in RED are required)
<SSO>
 <Authentication>
 <UserName></UserName>
 <Password></Password>

 <EmailAddress> </EmailAddress>
 </Applicant>
 <Address>
 <StreetAddress> </StreetAddress>
 <City> </City>
 <State> </State>
 <ZipCode></ZipCode>

 </SSO>
If request is successful, the requesting user will be automatically logged into the system
to complete the request.

Status Updates & Results
Once you or your applicant have completed the data entry to order the background check the
following status update XML will be posted back to the status update URL provided with the
initial order:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SSO>
 <Authentication>
 <UserName></UserName>
 <Password></Password>
 </Authentication>
 <Status>In Progress</Status>
 <Applicant>
 <ReferenceNumber></ReferenceNumber>
 </Applicant>
</SSO>
When the background check has been completed the following XML will sent to the result post
URL provided at time of order:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SSO>
 <Authentication>
 <UserName></UserName>
 <Password></Password>
 </Authentication>
 <Status>Complete</Status>
<Recommendation></Recommendation>
 <ReportURL></ReportURL>
 <ReportId></ReportId> You should store this value in your system. You will need it to pull the
result of the background check.
 <Applicant>
 <ReferenceNumber></ReferenceNumber>
 </Applicant>
</SSO>
Note that any response but a 200 ok will be seen as a failure and the system will make 4 more
attempts to send the results back to your system. We do use the same credentials for the
result post as were used when the order was sent to our system. You can get access to the full
report result through the URL provided in the <ReportURL> element.
