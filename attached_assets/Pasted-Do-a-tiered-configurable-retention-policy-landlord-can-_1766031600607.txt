Do a tiered, configurable retention policy (landlord can change it), with safe defaults:

Denied / Withdrawn applications

Default: retain 2 years, then auto-delete uploads unless landlord manually archives/exported.
Why: aligns with the “many jurisdictions require at least two years” concept and keeps sensitive docs from sitting around forever. 
Snappt

Approved / Moved-in tenants

Default: keep during tenancy + 7 years after move-out (or configurable).
Why: common “defensive recordkeeping” guidance for leases/tenant files is 6–7 years in many discussions.

Highly sensitive financial uploads (bank statements)

Default: keep 90–180 days for denied/withdrawn, and 2 years for approved tenants (or “tenancy + 1 year”), unless landlord opts longer.
Why: bank statements are high-risk to store. Landlords usually only need them to verify income during decisioning, not forever.

Document Storage & Retention
Uploaded documents are stored to support the rental application process and recordkeeping. By default, documents for denied or withdrawn applications are retained for 2 years, and documents for approved tenants are retained for the duration of tenancy plus 7 years, unless the landlord/property manager configures different retention settings. Applicants should upload only documents requested by the landlord/property manager.
