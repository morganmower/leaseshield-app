Evaluation of Proposed Tasks
1️⃣ Show guide when no properties exist

Verdict: ✅ STRONG YES (highest priority)

This is the single biggest activation lever you have.

Why this matters

A landlord with no properties:

Can’t run applications

Can’t use documents

Can’t see value yet

Without guidance, they stall.

What the guide should say (exact copy)

Headline:
Get Started

Body:
Add your first property to send applications, route screening through Western Verify, and access state-specific documents.

Primary button:
Add Your First Property

Secondary (optional):
Why do I need a property?
→ Explains: applications + documents are property-based

Placement

Center of the empty state

Card style, not modal

No pop-ups

2️⃣ Show guide when no applications exist

Verdict: ✅ YES (second priority)

This helps users understand what LeaseShield is best at, not just what it stores.

What the guide should say

Headline:
Start Your First Application

Body:
Send one link to the applicant. LeaseShield tracks the process while screening runs through Western Verify.

Primary button:
Create Application Link

Secondary (optional):
See how it works (2 min)

Key point

This reinforces:

LeaseShield = control center

Western Verify = screening engine

3️⃣ Show guide when no documents exist

Verdict: ⚠️ YES, but keep it lighter

Documents are important, but they’re not always used immediately.

What the guide should say

Headline:
Need a Lease or Notice?

Body:
Browse state-specific leases and notices updated when legislation changes.

Primary button:
Browse Leases & Notices

Don’t

Over-emphasize fear here

Make it feel like a blocker

4️⃣ Add helpful tips to dashboard cards

Verdict: ✅ YES — this is polish done right

This improves clarity without clutter.

Rules for tips

One sentence max

Explains why, not how

Appears under the card title or as a tooltip

Recommended tip copy (use verbatim if you want)

Applications card tip:
Send one link. Screening runs through Western Verify.

Decoder card tip:
Prevents misinterpretation of screening reports.

Documents card tip:
Updated as laws change to reduce enforceability risk.

Properties card tip (if shown):
Properties organize applications and documents by location.

Priority Order (Do This In Order)

1️⃣ Empty state guide for No Properties
2️⃣ Empty state guide for No Applications
3️⃣ Dashboard card tips
4️⃣ Empty state guide for No Documents

If you only complete the first two, you’ll already see better activation.

What NOT to Do

❌ No forced tours
❌ No pop-ups on login
❌ No long explanations
❌ No green “success” buttons everywhere

Keep everything calm, optional, and landlord-respectful.

Final Read

These tasks align perfectly with where LeaseShield is right now:

Product is solid

Story is clear

Now you’re removing friction

This is maturity work, not feature creep.
