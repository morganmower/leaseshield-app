Exact tooltip copy for each dashboard card (short, safe, landlord-appropriate)

Pressure-test of your empty states through a skeptical landlord lens (what they think, what reassures them, and why your copy passes)

No fluff, no SaaS jargon.

PART 1: Exact Tooltip Copy (Use Verbatim)
Rules these follow (important)

One sentence max

Explains why, not how

No legal promises

Calm, compliance-first tone

Works on hover or tap (mobile)

🏠 Properties Card — Tooltip

Tooltip text:
Properties organize applications, screening, and documents by location.

Why this works:
It answers the “why do I have to do this?” objection without friction.

📝 Applications / Screening Card — Tooltip

Tooltip text:
Send one link to the applicant. Screening runs through Western Verify.

Why this works:

Clarifies roles instantly

Reinforces integration without overexplaining

Eliminates “who’s doing what?” confusion

🧠 Screening Decoder Card — Tooltip

Tooltip text:
Prevents misinterpretation of screening reports.

Why this works:
This reframes the decoder as risk prevention, not convenience or AI novelty.

📄 Leases & Notices Card — Tooltip

Tooltip text:
State-specific documents updated when legislation changes.

Why this works:
It creates ongoing value without fear-mongering.

⚖️ Legislation Updates (if separate card) — Tooltip

Tooltip text:
See when documents change due to new laws.

Why this works:
This reassures landlords they’re not missing something important.

⚙️ Settings / Integration Card — Tooltip (if visible)

Tooltip text:
Configure how LeaseShield works with Western Verify.

Why this works:
Keeps power users comfortable without overwhelming new users.

PART 2: Pressure-Test Against a Skeptical Landlord Persona

Let’s pressure-test your empty states against a realistic persona.

The Persona (Very Common)

“I’ve been a landlord for 15–20 years.
I already have leases.
I already run background checks.
I don’t want another system telling me how to do my job.”

This person is:

Skeptical

Risk-aware

Time-constrained

Not impressed by tech

Empty State: NO PROPERTIES
Their internal thought:

“Why do I need to add a property? I just want to screen someone.”

Your copy says:

Add your first property to send applications, route screening through Western Verify, and access state-specific leases and notices.

Why this passes the test

✔ Explains purpose, not requirement
✔ Ties property directly to value
✔ Doesn’t sound like software bureaucracy

Result: Resistance drops.

Empty State: NO APPLICATIONS
Their internal thought:

“I already have my own process. Why would I use this?”

Your copy says:

Send one link to the applicant. LeaseShield tracks the process while screening runs through Western Verify.

Why this passes

✔ Mentally compares favorably to email + PDFs
✔ Emphasizes control and tracking
✔ Doesn’t replace Western Verify — complements it

Result: Curiosity instead of dismissal.

Empty State: NO DOCUMENTS USED
Their internal thought:

“My lease works fine. Why change it?”

Your copy says:

Browse state-specific leases and notices updated when legislation changes.

Why this passes

✔ No accusation (“your lease is bad”)
✔ No fear (“you’re at risk”)
✔ Softly introduces change over time

Result: Defensive walls stay down.

Empty State: DECODER (No Report Yet)
Their internal thought:

“I know how to read a report.”

Your copy says:

Most landlords misinterpret at least one item on every screening report. This prevents that.

Why this passes

✔ Non-judgmental
✔ Inclusive (“most landlords”)
✔ Positions tool as a safety net

Result: Even confident landlords try it “just to check.”

Why This All Works Together

What you’ve built now does three very important things for skeptical users:

It never implies they’re doing something wrong

It never overpromises legal outcomes

It always frames LeaseShield as support, not replacement

That is exactly how compliance tools should behave.

Final Recommendation (Lock This In)

You are at the point where:

Tooltips = done

Empty states = correct

Tone = right for your market

From here forward, feedback should come from:

Real usage

Support questions

“I didn’t realize it did X” moments

Not more hypothetical UX tweaks.
