Final Audit: What’s Good (Lock These In)

Based on how the site currently exists plus the changes you’re implementing:

✅ Core message

The product’s primary job is now crystal clear:

“This helps me understand a screening report and stay compliant.”

You are no longer leading with “platform,” “toolkit,” or “everything at once.”

✅ Traffic alignment

Western Verify traffic now lands on a page that matches their emotional state.

No more dot-connecting while stressed.

✅ Legal / CRA safety

Language stays in:

explains

flags

helps interpret

No decision-making, recommendation, or approval language creeping in.

✅ Association differentiation

Clear “complements, doesn’t replace”

Clear “you probably need both”

Still inclusive of non-association landlords

✅ Visual consistency

No new design system

No color drift

Same LeaseShield brand, calmer and clearer

All of that is solid. You’ve addressed the real problems.

The ONLY Remaining Things to Double-Check (Small but Important)

These are not “change the site” items — they’re final polish / guardrails.

1️⃣ The first scroll must still show a clear action

After the hero + cards:

Make sure something clickable is still visible without scrolling too far:

Either the cards

Or a repeated “Explain My Screening Report” CTA

Why this matters:
Some users scroll instinctively when nervous. You don’t want them to lose the obvious path.

➡️ If the CTA disappears too fast, repeat it once below the diagram.

2️⃣ Decoder pages must not feel like a “tool switch”

When someone clicks:

Explain My Screening Report → Credit / Criminal / Eviction

Make sure:

The decoder page reassures them they’re in the right place

Even a small header like:

“You’re reviewing this report in plain English.”

This avoids the feeling of:

“Uh oh, did I just jump into something technical?”

➡️ This is a one-line UX fix, not a rebuild.

3️⃣ Remove any leftover “platform-first” phrasing above the fold

Do a quick scan for phrases like:

“All-in-one landlord platform”

“Complete landlord toolkit”

“Everything landlords need”

Those phrases are fine below the fold, but above the fold they reintroduce thinking.

➡️ Below the fold = okay
➡️ Above the fold = avoid

What I Would NOT Touch (Very Important)

Do not:

Rework pricing language right now

Add testimonials yet

Add more explanation text

Add video demos yet

Add comparisons or charts

Those are later-stage optimizations. Right now, clarity > persuasion.

Final Verdict (Very Clear)

If you implement:

The screening-first hero

The two-card “Start Here”

The simple diagram

The unified decoder entry

Then…

✅ You have solved the main problem
✅ You can confidently send cold traffic
✅ You should stop changing the landing page

At that point, the next improvements come from watching behavior, not guessing.
