Final Homepage Recommendation for LeaseShield

(Approved Scope: Copy + light structure + visuals only — no redesign)

Executive Decision

Do not expand the page. Do not add heavy sections. Do not change tone.
Your homepage already wins on trust, restraint, and credibility.

The goal now is faster understanding in the first 5–8 seconds, not more persuasion.

What to Keep Exactly as Is (Critical)

These are working and should not be touched:

Calm, compliance-first tone (no SaaS hype)

Minimal navigation (Log In + Start Trial only)

Pricing transparency and guarantee

Western Verify already positioned as a Trusted Partner

Risk → solution narrative (evictions, compliance exposure)

Overall visual cleanliness and spacing

This restraint is a competitive advantage in your category.

Final Changes to Implement (Only These)
1️⃣ Add ONE Workflow Line to the Hero (Highest ROI)

Location: Directly under the main hero headline/subheadline
Purpose: Instantly answers “How does this fit into what I already do?”

Exact copy to add:

Collect applications → Run screening via our trusted partner Western Verify → Decode results with AI guidance → Build compliant leases & notices—all in one simple dashboard.

Why this works:

One line, not a section

Explains end-to-end flow immediately

No extra visual clutter

Aligns perfectly with the in-app experience

2️⃣ Add a Compact “How It Works” Section Above the Fold

Placement: Immediately after the hero
Structure: 3 steps, light icons optional, no long paragraphs

Exact copy (use verbatim):

How LeaseShield Works in 3 Simple Steps

1. Collect & Screen
Send applicants a link. Screening runs seamlessly through Western Verify—our trusted integration partner.

2. Understand Results Fast
AI-powered decoder explains reports clearly, flags risks, and guides fair housing compliance.

3. Protect with Compliant Documents
Access attorney-reviewed, state-specific leases, notices, and checklists—updated monthly.

Why this works:

Mirrors the in-app flow users now see

Proves simplicity without claiming it

No redundancy with later content

Reduces bounce from “this looks complicated” visitors

3️⃣ Add a Short Differentiation Bullet Block (NOT a Full Section)

Placement: Immediately after “How It Works”
Purpose: Answer “Why this vs what I already do?” without text bloat

Exact copy:

Why Independent Landlords Choose LeaseShield

Everything in one place—no juggling PDFs, emails, or multiple sites

Built-in guidance to avoid costly screening and decoding mistakes

Always-updated templates—no chasing law changes

Flat, affordable pricing for small portfolios (not enterprise bloat)

This replaces the need for a long “Why Switch?” section.

4️⃣ Move the “Sneak Peek” Higher + Use Real Dashboard Screens

Change: Positional + content upgrade, not redesign

Move “Sneak Peek” closer to the top (just below “How It Works”)

Use real dashboard screenshots (from your app, not mockups)

Why this matters:

Visually proves simplicity faster than copy

Reinforces “this already exists and is usable”

Matches the confidence of your logged-in experience

5️⃣ Small Pricing Reinforcement (One Line Only)

Under pricing table, add:

No contracts • Cancel anytime • No per-screening fees • Works alongside your existing tools

This quietly removes friction without selling harder.

What to Explicitly Avoid (Important)

Do not implement these, even if suggested later:

Long new sections or paragraphs

Repeating Western Verify explanations multiple times

Chat widgets or pop-ups

Aggressive CTAs

SEO keyword stuffing

Overloading testimonials

Your audience values restraint more than persuasion.
