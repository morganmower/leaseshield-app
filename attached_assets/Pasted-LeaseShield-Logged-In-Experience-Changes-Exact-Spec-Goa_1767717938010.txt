LeaseShield Logged-In Experience Changes (Exact Spec)
Goal

When someone logs in, they should instantly understand LeaseShield is:

Application → Western Verify screening (integrated workflow)

AI screening helpers/decoders

Updated leases/notices tied to legislation

And they should know what to click first.

1) Dashboard: Add a “Hero” panel at the very top
Placement

First element on the dashboard page, before any cards or tools list.

Content (exact text)

Headline:
Protect your rentals in 3 steps.

Subheadline:
Run applications through Western Verify, decode screening reports in plain English, and use updated state-specific leases & notices when legislation changes.

3 Pill tags (small badges):

Application → Western Verify Screening

AI Screening Helpers

Updated Leases & Notices

Primary button (most prominent):

Start an Application
(links to your application workflow / create application / invite applicant)

Secondary buttons:

Use the Decoder

Open Leases & Notices

Small “tip” line under buttons:
Tip: Most landlords misinterpret at least one item on every screening report. The decoder highlights what matters and what to ask next.

Visual requirements

Use your primary navy/brand color as the primary CTA

Light background tint for the hero panel to “stand out” from the rest of the page

This should be the strongest “pop” on the page without feeling salesy

2) Dashboard: Add a “Start Here (Recommended)” section
Placement

Directly under the hero panel.

Section title

Start Here (Recommended)

Subtitle

If you do nothing else today, follow this flow.

Step list (exact text)

1) Collect an application + route screening through Western Verify
One link to the applicant → authorization captured → screening runs → status updates inside LeaseShield.
Buttons:

Create Application Link

View Application Status

2) Review results using AI Screening Helpers (Credit/Criminal/Eviction)
Paste/upload report text. Get plain-English explanations, risk flags, and the best follow-up questions.
Button:

Open Screening Decoder

3) Use updated state-specific documents when you need to act
Leases and notices updated as legislation changes — late rent, violations, non-renewal, and more.
Button:

Browse Leases & Notices

Visual requirements

Each step should have:

a bold title

1 short explanatory line

a button

Keep the whole section visible without scrolling too far (don’t let it get huge)

3) Reorganize the tools on the dashboard into 3 “pillars”

Right now, your tools likely appear as a flat list. Instead, group them as:

Pillar A: Applications + Screening (Western Verify)

Title: Applications + Western Verify Screening
Description (exact):
The easiest compliant flow: apply → authorize → screen → decide.

Bullets:

Applicant completes application

Authorization captured

Screening runs through Western Verify

Status updates + reports ready

Buttons:

Create Application

Integration Settings (if you have it)

Pillar B: AI Screening Helpers

Title: AI Screening Helpers
Description (exact):
Credit / Criminal / Eviction explained in plain English — with the best follow-up questions.

Bullets:

Key risk flags (and what they mean)

Suggested questions to ask applicants

Decision notes you can save

Buttons:

Open Decoder

(Optional) View Example (if you have sample input)

Pillar C: Updated Leases & Notices

Title: Updated Leases & Notices
Description (exact):
State-specific templates updated when laws change.

Bullets:

Leases

Late rent + violation notices

Move-in / move-out checklists

Adverse action letters (if you have them inside LeaseShield)

Buttons:

Browse Documents

See Recent Updates

4) Add “value microcopy” on each major page (1–2 lines)

This is important: you already have the tools, but people need to feel the why.

On the Decoder page, add at the top:

Paste any screening report below. LeaseShield explains what matters, what doesn’t, and what to ask next.

On the Documents page, add at the top:

Leases and notices are updated when legislation changes. Choose your state to view the latest versions.

On the Applications page, add at the top:

Send one link to the applicant. LeaseShield routes screening through Western Verify and tracks each step.

5) Add one trust line (subtle, not scary)

Place in small text in the dashboard footer or near documents:

Built for compliance-minded landlords. Always confirm local requirements with counsel.

This increases trust without over-lawyering the UI.

6) Labels to adjust to match landlord language (if applicable)

Here are common label upgrades that reduce confusion:

“Decoder” → Screening Decoder

“Criminal Decoder” → Criminal Report Decoder

“Credit Decoder” → Credit Report Decoder

“Documents” → Leases & Notices

“Updates” → Legislation Updates or Recent Document Updates

“Integrations” → Western Verify Integration

7) Visual hierarchy tweaks (do this even if nothing else changes)

Primary action should always be Start an Application

Secondary action: Use Decoder

Third action: Documents

Make the primary button a stronger color and larger than others

Add icons only if they’re consistent and subtle (not required)
