LeaseShield – Quick Tour (90 Seconds)
Opening (0:00–0:10)

Welcome to LeaseShield.
This is a quick overview of how the system works and how most landlords use it.

What LeaseShield Is (0:10–0:25)

LeaseShield is the control center for your rental workflow.
It helps you collect applications, understand screening results, and use the right documents when laws change.

LeaseShield manages the workflow. Western Verify performs the screening.

Properties (0:25–0:40)

Everything starts with a property.
Properties organize your applications, screening, and documents by location.

Once a property is added, you can send applications and access state-specific leases and notices.

Applications & Screening (0:40–1:00)

When you create an application, LeaseShield generates a single link for the applicant.

The applicant completes the application and authorization.
Screening runs through Western Verify, and LeaseShield tracks the status in one place.

Screening Decoder (1:00–1:15)

After screening is complete, you can use the Screening Decoder.

Paste or upload the report, and LeaseShield explains what matters, what doesn’t, and what to ask next — helping prevent misinterpretation.

Documents & Close (1:15–1:30)

When it’s time to act, LeaseShield provides state-specific leases and notices updated as legislation changes.

If you’re not sure where to begin, start by adding a property or creating your first application.

That’s LeaseShield.
