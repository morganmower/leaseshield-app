Looks good — the only thing I’d tighten is naming + mode defaults so it’s impossible to accidentally publish, and you don’t end up with two “monthly” concepts.

Here are the final tweaks I’d make before you code it:

Small adjustments to your plan (worth doing)
1) Mode names: make “safe” explicit

Use:

mode=queueOnly (default)

mode=ingestOnly

mode=publishApproved

Avoid safe as a mode name — it’s ambiguous later.

Default behavior should always be queueOnly.

2) Put the approval gate in two places (belt + suspenders)

You already said publishApproved() only publishes approved items — perfect.
Also add a guard in the route layer:

If mode=publishApproved but there are 0 approved items, return success with publishedCount=0 (don’t error).

If someone tries mode=publishAll or anything else, return 400.

3) Idempotency: dedupe review queue inserts

In queueFromLatestIngest():

enforce a unique constraint like:

(template_id, normalized_update_id) or

(template_id, update_fingerprint)
So re-running /run doesn’t spam the queue.

4) Keep old runMonthlyMonitoring() but hard-disable it

Instead of deleting immediately, keep it for a week but make it throw:

throw new Error("Deprecated: use ingestNow()/queueFromLatestIngest()/publishApproved()");


This prevents a hidden caller (cron, another route, an old admin button) from silently doing risky publishing.

5) Lock naming: separate ingest vs publish (optional)

If your ingest takes a while and you want to allow publish separately, use two locks:

legislative-ingest

legislative-publish

If you want maximum safety/simplicity, one lock legislative-monitoring is fine.

Your summary (approved version)

✅ Add job lock utility (server/utils/jobLock.ts)
✅ Refactor /run as orchestrator with mode query param (default queueOnly)
✅ Update /ingest and /publish to use the lock + synchronous results
✅ Add service methods:

ingestNow() → wraps runNightlyIngest()

queueFromLatestIngest() → queues review entries from new normalized updates (deduped)

publishApproved() → publishes only approved items
✅ Remove/disable old runMonthlyMonitoring() from routes/schedules

If you want one more “pro” touch: have /run return a consistent payload shape:

{
  "success": true,
  "mode": "queueOnly",
  "result": {
    "ingest": { "sources": {...}, "newRaw": 12, "newNormalized": 4 },
    "queue": { "updatesQueued": 3, "templatesQueued": 9 }
  }
}


That makes your admin UI trivial.
