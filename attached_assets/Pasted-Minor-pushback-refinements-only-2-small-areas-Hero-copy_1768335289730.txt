Minor pushback / refinements (only 2 small areas):

Hero copy change — Agree it's the #1 lift, but make it even tighter to avoid any wordiness.
Current is good, but ChatGPT's version is slightly long. Use this refined version (same intent, fewer words):
Headline: Confused by a Screening Report?
Subheadline: LeaseShield explains it in plain English — flags risks, shows safe next steps.
(Shorter = faster read = higher impact.)
Dashboard preview clarifier — Agree 100% on adding the sentence ("What you’ll see after logging in..."), but place it above the preview (not below) so it sets expectation immediately.
Suggested exact line:
"A preview of what you'll see after signing up — everything in one simple dashboard."

No other pushback — the rest is flawless: keep the decoder UI as-is (it's the real tool, not marketing), make quick buttons look/feel clickable (huge UX win), fix states (15 + Illinois), add pricing reassurance (kills hesitation).
Final Prioritized "To 10/10" Action List (Send This to Replit Verbatim)
Copy-paste this block directly into Replit — it's the safest, smallest, highest-impact set of changes:
textPerform these exact, small polish changes only. No layout redesigns, no new pages, no component rewrites.

1. Hero Copy Update (highest ROI)
   Replace current hero headline + subheadline with:
   Headline: Confused by a Screening Report?
   Subheadline: LeaseShield explains it in plain English — flags risks, shows safe next steps.
   Keep existing primary CTA "Explain My Screening Report" and secondary "Start Free 7-Day Trial".
   Support line stays: "Works instantly with Western Verify and other providers."

2. Dashboard Preview Clarifier (trust booster)
   Above the existing static dashboard preview section (the 4-card grid), add this single line (small gray text):
   "A preview of what you'll see after signing up — everything in one simple dashboard."

3. Make Decoder Quick-Start Buttons Clickable (UX fix)
   In the Screening Decoder section (where you have "Charge-off?", "Low score?", etc.):
   - Change them from flat text to rounded pill buttons.
   - Add subtle shadow, hover effect (bg-brand-50), cursor pointer.
   - On click, auto-fill the input box with a sample prompt (e.g., clicking "Charge-off?" fills: "What does charge-off mean and should I be worried?").
   Use this Tailwind pattern for each:
   <button className="px-5 py-3 bg-white border border-ink-300 rounded-full text-sm font-medium text-ink-700 hover:bg-brand-50 hover:border-brand-300 hover:shadow-md transition-all cursor-pointer shadow-sm">
     Charge-off?
   </button>
   Repeat for all four.

4. States & Pricing Trust Fixes (quick wins)
   - Update state count from 14 to 15 everywhere (badges, footer, etc.).
   - Add "Illinois" to the state list/grid.
   - Under pricing ($10/mo, $100/yr), add this small reassurance line:
     "Cancel anytime • No contracts • No per-screening fees"

5. Final Checks
   - Confirm hero feels more urgent/pain-first.
   - Quick buttons look raised/tappable and auto-fill input.
   - No layout changes — only copy, 1 clarifier line, button styles, and state/pricing text.
   - Test mobile: Everything stacks cleanly.
   - No new tokens, no dark mode changes (keep current).
