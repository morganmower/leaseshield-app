Perfect — I’m going to give you a very concrete, designer-level spec you can hand straight to Replit (or implement yourself) without interpretation. This will fix the “cheap / SaaS-template” feel and make the section feel intentional, premium, and confident, consistent with the rest of LeaseShield.

I’ll break this into (A) structure, (B) colors, (C) typography, and (D) exact layout rules.

A. SECTION STRUCTURE (WHAT GOES WHERE)
1️⃣ Full-width “Decision Section” wrapper

This is critical.

Purpose:
Visually signal: “You’re now making a choice.”

Wrapper styles

Background: #F9FAFB (very light neutral gray)

Padding top/bottom: 64px

Padding left/right: same as rest of page

Max width: same container as hero

This immediately gives weight and separation.

2️⃣ Section header (replace “START HERE” entirely)
Header block (centered)
What would you like help with right now?
Most landlords start by explaining an existing screening report.


Why this works

Human

Confident

No shouting

No marketing fluff

3️⃣ Two-card decision row

Grid: 2 columns desktop, stacked mobile

Gap between cards: 32px

The left card is the hero. The right card is clearly secondary.

B. COLOR SCHEME (EXACT VALUES)

You already have a strong brand palette — we’re just using it correctly.

LEFT CARD (PRIMARY PATH)

This should feel safe, premium, and obvious.

Background

#ECFDF5 (very soft green tint)

Border

None (important — borders feel cheap here)

Shadow

0 10px 30px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.15)

(Matches Tailwind emerald family)

Creates depth without harsh contrast

Accent color

Primary green: #10B981

Icon background: #10B981

Icon color: #FFFFFF

RIGHT CARD (SECONDARY PATH)

This should feel available but quieter.

Background

#FFFFFF

Border

1px solid #E5E7EB (light gray)

Shadow

0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)

Accent color

Neutral slate/gray

Icon background: #F3F4F6

Icon color: #6B7280

CTA BUTTON (INSIDE LEFT CARD)

This is important: the CTA lives inside the left card, not below.

Background: #10B981

Text: #FFFFFF

Hover: #059669

Border radius: 12px

Height: 48px

Font weight: 600

C. TYPOGRAPHY (FONTS & SIZES)

Use whatever font family you already have site-wide (likely Inter or similar).
Do not introduce new fonts.

Section header text
Main header

Font size: 32px

Font weight: 700

Color: #111827

Line height: 1.2

Subheader

Font size: 16px

Font weight: 400

Margin top: 8px

Card titles

Card body text

Keep this short. No arrows. No workflows.

D. EXACT CARD CONTENT (COPY + PLACEMENT)
LEFT CARD (PRIMARY)
Icon

Size: 48px x 48px

Rounded: 12px

Green background

Simple magnifying glass icon (solid)

Title
Explain My Screening Report

Description (one sentence)
Plain-English explanations of credit, criminal, or eviction reports — with compliance risk flags.

CTA (inside card, bottom-left)

Button text:

Explain My Screening Report →


Do NOT add secondary links.

RIGHT CARD (SECONDARY)
Icon

Size: 40px x 40px

Light gray background

User + document icon

Title
New Tenant Application + Screening

Description
Send an application link and run screening through Western Verify as part of a full compliant workflow.


No CTA button here — just arrow icon in top-right corner.

E. WHAT TO REMOVE (IMPORTANT)

To avoid the “cheap” feel:

❌ Remove:

Diagram with pastel icons

Thin arrows

“START HERE” eyebrow text

Any text saying “Most people choose…” inside cards

Borders on the primary card

F. WHY THIS WILL FEEL PREMIUM

This approach works because:

You’re using depth, not borders

You’re using contrast, not clutter

You’re letting one path dominate visually

You’re aligning with the calm, confident tone of the decoder UI

You’re avoiding SaaS-template clichés

The user experience becomes:

“Oh — this is clearly what I’m supposed to do.”

FINAL INSTRUCTION (IMPORTANT)

Implement exactly this, then stop.

Do not tweak spacing endlessly afterward.
Do not add more explanation.
