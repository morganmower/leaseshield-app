Perfect — your palette is clean and exactly what we should use. Below is the authoritative class-name standard for LeaseShield going forward, plus exact replacements you can hand to Replit so it doesn’t “guess” shades you don’t have.

The only colors we will use (based on your config)
Brand (green)


Primary CTA / highlights: bg-brand-500


Hover: hover:bg-brand-600


Darker accents (rare): text-brand-700


Light background wash: bg-brand-50


Light border: border-brand-200


Ink (text)


Headings: text-ink-900


Body: text-ink-700


Muted/supporting: text-ink-500


Panel (surface)


Section alt background: bg-panel-50


Small surface blocks: bg-panel-100


Borders (important because you don’t have ink-100/ink-300)
Use Tailwind slate borders instead of inventing ink shades:


Standard border: border-slate-200


Dark mode border: dark:border-slate-800


This is totally fine even with your token system, and avoids adding missing ink shades.

Dark mode standard (do this everywhere)


Page background: bg-white dark:bg-slate-950


Cards: bg-white dark:bg-slate-950


Panel areas: bg-panel-50 dark:bg-slate-900


Headings: text-ink-900 dark:text-white


Body: text-ink-700 dark:text-slate-300


Muted: text-ink-500 dark:text-slate-400


Borders: border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-800

Section title sizing fix (this addresses your “looks legal / cheap” complaint)
For every subtitle/kicker block that looks tiny (“Beyond screening”, “Simple workflow”, “Built by professionals”, “Designed to complement…”):
Use this exact pattern:
Kicker (optional)
<div className="text-xs font-semibold tracking-[0.18em] text-ink-500">
  KICKER TEXT
</div>

Title
<h2 className="mt-2 text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-ink-900 dark:text-white md:text-4xl">
  Section title here
</h2>

Body
<p className="mt-3 text-base text-ink-700 dark:text-slate-300">
  One sentence. No legal tone.
</p>

This alone makes the page feel 10x more “SaaS” and 0x “fine print”.

CTA button standard (do not deviate)
Primary button:
className="bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600 text-white"

Secondary outline:
className="border-slate-300 dark:border-slate-700"


Illinois + 15 states (single source of truth)
Create ONE array (landing + footer) and reuse count:
const STATES = [
  "Utah","Texas","North Dakota","South Dakota","North Carolina","Ohio","Michigan",
  "Idaho","Wyoming","California","Virginia","Nevada","Arizona","Florida","Illinois"
];

Anywhere you show “states covered”, display:
{STATES.length}

That will always be 15.

One critical design call (prevents “cheap”)
If you want the page to feel premium, do NOT use tiny centered single-line sections for:


“Built by professionals…”


“Designed to complement association…”


Instead, make them real blocks (title + 2–3 value cards), or move them into FAQ.
Tiny centered lines read like disclaimers. That’s why it feels legal.

If you want, paste your current landing.tsx (or just the sections you hate: Beyond Screening / Simple Workflow / Built By / Association) and I’ll rewrite only those sections with the exact classes above so you can drop them in without changing the rest.
