Issue on Live Site
Exact Fix (Replit + DNS Steps)
Expected Lift
Critical (Do Now)
Domain shows only title + dashes—no full content
1. In Replit: Confirm "Run" is active → Copy preview URL (e.g., leaseshield-app.mower4.repl.co).
2. Registrar DNS: Add/update CNAME record: www → [your Replit preview URL] (TTL 300s).
3. Test propagation: Use whatsmydns.net → Search www.leaseshieldapp.com (global check).
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) + test incognito. Wait 5–60 min.
Blank → 60–80% conversion
Critical
No CTAs or Stripe integration visible
Deploys automatically once DNS points. Verify: Preview URL clicks to Stripe? If yes, live site will too.
+150% signups
High
No value hooks (headlines, calc, badges)
Already in Replit HTML—DNS fix loads them. If stuck, force-refresh Replit deploy (stop/start Run).
+40% engagement
High
Missing screenshots/previews
Upload 3 real mocks (lease form, notice, decoder) to imgur.com → Replace placeholders in Replit: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/[your-link].png"> (3 spots).
+25% trust
Medium
Unstyled/minimal layout on mobile/desktop
Replit CSS fixes it—ensure style.css is saved and linked (<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />).
Mobile bounce -50%
Medium
Weak meta/SEO (no keywords)
Add to Replit <head>: <meta name="keywords" content="utah landlord lease, texas eviction notice 2025, credit report decoder">.
+10–15% organic traffic
Low
No analytics or favicon
<head> add: <link rel="icon" href="https://i.imgur.com/simple-shield.png"> + GA script (free ID).

5-Minute Action PlanDNS Double-Check: Registrar → DNS → Confirm CNAME is set correctly (no typos in Replit URL). If using Cloudflare/others, purge cache.
Replit Refresh: Save files → Run → Visit preview → All good? Share screenshot here.
Test Blast: Email 1 test lead: "New page live—thoughts? [Preview URL]" → Switch to domain once propagated.
If Stuck: Reply with registrar name (e.g., GoDaddy) + screenshot of DNS settings—I'll walk through exact clicks.
