Right now your bottleneck is clear: DB is already the source of truth (states table), but the frontend still uses scattered SUPPORTED_STATES constants. Fix that once, and adding states becomes mostly seed + templates + compliance content.

The best way to make “add a state” easy every time
1) Make the database the single source of truth for states

You already have:

states table with id, name, isActive ✅

templates.stateId references states ✅

Do this next:

Create an API endpoint: GET /api/states?active=true

Frontend replaces every SUPPORTED_STATES array with API results.

Result: Adding IL is one DB insert and the UI automatically includes it.

Bonus: enforce referential integrity on properties

Right now properties.state and rentalProperties.state are plain varchar.
Make them reference states.id (foreign key) so nobody stores Ill, Illinois, or IL .

Illinois rollout checklist (the actual work you need to do)
A) Add Illinois to the database

Seed file
Add:

{ id: "IL", name: "Illinois", description: "..." }


Run seed / migration.

This makes IL available to the backend and any state-driven queries.

B) Eliminate hardcoded state arrays in the frontend (big win)

You said signup.tsx and “similar patterns exist in compliance/settings/etc.”

Replace pattern:

const SUPPORTED_STATES = [...]


With:

useStates() hook that calls /api/states?active=true

Cache it (React Query or your existing fetch wrapper)

Now every dropdown just uses the API and you never touch frontend code when adding states.

C) Templates: create Illinois document set (minimum viable)

For IL you’ll need at least:

Leasing

IL Lease (or IL addendum if you do “base lease + state addendum”)

Move-in / move-out checklist (mostly universal + state notes)

Notices

Late rent notice (IL-specific timing/wording)

Notice to cure/quit (if you support violations)

Termination notice templates (month-to-month, etc.)

Screening/compliance

IL-specific disclosures you include in your flow (if any)

Adverse action templates are federal-driven, but some state extras may apply

Implementation note:
You’ll be 10x faster long-term if you move to:

Base template (generic) + state overlay blocks (IL deltas)
instead of maintaining 50 fully separate state documents.

If you’re not ready for overlays, do IL as separate templates now but structure your template content so overlaying is easy later.
