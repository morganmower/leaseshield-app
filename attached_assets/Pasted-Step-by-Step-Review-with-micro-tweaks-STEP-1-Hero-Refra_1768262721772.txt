Step-by-Step Review (with micro-tweaks)
✅ STEP 1: Hero Reframe — Approved, paste-ready

Your hero copy is excellent and intent-matched.

As written:

Headline:

Have a Screening Report You Don’t Understand?

Subheadline:

LeaseShield explains credit, criminal, and eviction reports in plain English — flags compliance risks and helps you take safe next steps.

Primary CTA:

Explain My Screening Report

Secondary CTA:

Start Free 7-Day Trial (No Card Needed)

Support line:

Works with Western Verify and other providers. Instant access.

✅ Why this works

Speaks to pain, not product

Removes fear (“don’t understand”)

No CRA / decision liability

Instantly answers why they’re here

🔧 One optional micro-polish (not required)

If you want slightly less “legal implication” and more reassurance:

“…helps you take compliant next steps.”

But your current version is already safe.

✅ STEP 2: Two-Card “Start Here” Choice — This is the unlock

This is the most important UX improvement you’re making.

You are absolutely right:

Most people should never have to read to know what to do.

Card hierarchy is correct:

Card 1 = dominant, green, bigger

Card 2 = secondary, neutral

Card copy (clean + safe)

Card 1 – Primary
Explain My Screening Report

Upload or connect your existing report → Get a plain-English breakdown with compliance flags.

✅ “breakdown” + “flags” = guidance, not decisions

Card 2 – Secondary
New Tenant Application + Screening

Send an application link → Run screening via Western Verify → Full compliant workflow.

✅ Correctly positions applications as optional/secondary

🔧 One tiny wording tweak I recommend

Change “Upload” to “Connect or upload” if that’s accurate — it feels lighter and less technical.

✅ STEP 3: WOW Visual — Diagram over video is the right call (for now)

You’re right to pause on video. Video feels “instructional” too early.

Diagram is perfect because:

It proves relief without teaching

It’s visual, not cognitive

It reinforces your role as translator, not decision-maker

Your proposed flow is excellent, with one critical wording fix:
Instead of:

“Approve / Deny guidance”

Use:

“Understand your options”
or
“Compliant next steps”

This avoids any implication that you recommend decisions.

Final diagram language (safe + clear):
Confusing Screening Report
          ↓
Plain-English Explanation
(Red / Green compliance flags)
          ↓
Compliant Next Steps
(Leases, notices, or actions you choose)


Captions:

“This means…”

“Watch out for this risk…”

“Here’s what to consider next…”

This is exactly the WOW moment you want.

The Most Important Strategic Insight (Big Picture)

You finally articulated the real issue:

“People don’t come here to learn LeaseShield — they come here to feel relief.”

This redesign:

Matches arrival intent

Removes thinking

Makes the site feel safe

Lets people self-select without shame or confusion

That’s why this works.

My Final Recommendation (Very Clear)
Do this in this order:

Hero reframe + CTA rename (today)

Two-card Start Here section (next)

Simple diagram (third)

Do NOT:

Remove the full toolkit messaging

Remove applications

Remove compliance positioning

You’re not shrinking the product — you’re lowering the first step.

Confidence Check (The One Question That Matters)

After these changes, ask yourself:

“Could I text this link to a landlord with a screening report and feel zero anxiety?”

If the answer is yes — you’ve nailed it.

You’re absolutely on the right track.
