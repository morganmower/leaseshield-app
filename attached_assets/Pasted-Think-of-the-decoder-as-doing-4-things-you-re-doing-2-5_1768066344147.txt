Think of the decoder as doing 4 things (you’re doing 2.5 right now):

Explain (what it means) ✅

Contextualize risk (why landlords care) ✅

Show compliant paths forward (how to proceed safely) ⚠️ partial

Create consistency + defensibility (this is the big unlock) ❌ not fully yet

Below are concrete enhancements you can add that increase value, reduce liability, and stay neutral.

1️⃣ Add a “What This Does Not Mean” section (huge trust boost)

Right now you explain what a charge-off is. Add a short counterbalance so landlords don’t overreact.

Example:

What This Does NOT Automatically Mean
• A charge-off does not mean the applicant will fail to pay rent.
• Older or medical charge-offs may have limited relevance to current rent behavior.
• A single charge-off can sometimes be the result of a one-time hardship (job loss, medical event).

Why this helps:

Reinforces you are not telling them what to do

Signals fairness and compliance mindset

Makes LeaseShield feel legally sophisticated, not fear-based

2️⃣ Replace “Steps to Protect Yourself” with “Common Screening Responses”

Language matters. “Steps to protect yourself” can sound like advice.
Instead, frame actions as commonly used screening responses.

Rename the section to:

Common Screening Responses Used by Landlords

Reframe bullets like this:

Some landlords require higher income ratios when derogatory credit items appear.

Some landlords allow a qualified co-signer to offset credit risk.

Some landlords apply longer rental history requirements in these cases.

Some landlords proceed only if the charge-off is older than X years.

Why this matters:
You’re describing industry behavior, not prescribing action.

3️⃣ Add a “Consistency Check” (this is a killer feature)

This keeps you neutral while adding massive compliance value.

New section:

Consistency Check (Important for Fair Housing)

Example output:

Before relying on this information, confirm that:
• You apply the same charge-off standards to every applicant
• Your written criteria address charge-offs (or credit score thresholds)
• You have not made exceptions based on protected characteristics

Optional AI follow-up:

If you'd like, paste your written screening criteria here and I can check whether this factor is addressed consistently.

This is huge value without making decisions.

4️⃣ Add a “Documentation Language” helper (non-decisional, high value)

Instead of telling them what to decide, help them document why.

New section:

Neutral Documentation Language (Optional)

Example:

“Application reviewed using standard screening criteria. Credit report reflects a charge-off dated [MM/YYYY]. Applicant was evaluated using the same credit standards applied to all applicants.”

This protects them whether they approve or deny.

5️⃣ Introduce “Risk Factors That Increase or Decrease Weight”

Instead of a single “Risk level: MEDIUM to HIGH”, give weighting factors.

Example:

Factors That Increase Weight
• Charge-off within the last 24 months
• Multiple charge-offs
• Charge-off amount exceeds one month’s rent

Factors That Reduce Weight
• Charge-off older than 3–5 years
• Medical or utility-related charge-off
• Evidence of stable income since the event

This helps landlords think clearly without you deciding.

6️⃣ Add a “How This Interacts With Other Report Sections”

This is advanced and very valuable.

Example:

How This Should Be Viewed Alongside Other Report Items
• A charge-off combined with recent late rent history increases concern
• A charge-off paired with strong rental references may carry less weight
• Multiple derogatory categories together often matter more than any single item

This reinforces holistic review — a compliance best practice.

7️⃣ Add a soft legal boundary statement (subtle but important)

At the bottom:

This explanation is informational only and does not direct approval or denial decisions. Final screening decisions should be based on your written criteria and applied consistently.

This protects you and increases perceived professionalism.

8️⃣ Optional next-level feature: “Policy Alignment Mode”

Later enhancement (this is powerful):

Landlord pastes their written screening criteria

Decoder responds with:

“This factor IS / IS NOT addressed in your policy”

“If relied upon, consider updating policy language for consistency”

You’re not deciding — you’re aligning.

Summary: What to change without crossing the line

You don’t need to remove anything you have.
You need to reframe + add structure.

Keep:

Plain-English explanation

Compliance reminders

Applicant questions

Add:

What this does not mean

Consistency checks

Documentation language

Weighting factors

Policy alignment framing
