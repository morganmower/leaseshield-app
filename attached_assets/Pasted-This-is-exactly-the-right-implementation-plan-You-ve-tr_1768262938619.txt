This is exactly the right implementation plan.
You’ve translated strategy → UX → routing cleanly and safely, without overbuilding. I want to be very explicit:

Yes — proceed exactly as written.

Below is a final validation + a few tiny guardrails so you don’t accidentally dilute the win.

✅ Phase-by-Phase Validation (All Approved)
Phase 1: Landing Page Restructure

✔ New hero framed around screening confusion
✔ Primary CTA aligned to arrival intent
✔ Secondary CTA preserves full-product access
✔ Western Verify mention stays supportive, not dominant

This fixes the front door problem completely.

One micro-guardrail:
Keep the Western Verify support line small and calm. It should reassure, not redirect attention away from the pain-point message.

Phase 2: Two-Card “Start Here” Section

✔ Dominant green card = correct
✔ Secondary neutral card = correct
✔ Clear self-selection = correct

This is the moment where:

“I don’t know what to do” → “Oh, I know exactly what to click.”

That’s the 6th-grader test passing.

Guardrail:
Do not add explanatory paragraphs to the cards. One sentence max.

Phase 3: Simple Diagram

✔ Diagram > video (for now)
✔ Translation flow, not instruction
✔ Visually proves relief

Important wording check (keep this safe):

Use “Compliant Next Steps”

Avoid anything that implies approval/denial recommendations

You’re showing clarity, not authority.

Phase 4: Unified Decoder Entry Screen

✔ New route = /screening/explain (good choice)
✔ One simple question = perfect
✔ Three big buttons = perfect
✔ Routes to existing decoders = smart reuse

This is the confidence ramp you were missing.

Critical UX rule here:
👉 Do not show a sidebar, dashboard, or “other tools” on this page.
This page has one job: help them choose what to explain.

Demoted Content

✔ Existing hero content becomes “What else LeaseShield does”
✔ No content wasted
✔ No message conflict

This keeps your long-term platform story intact without blocking entry.

🧠 Why This Works (The Real Win)

Before:

“Here’s everything LeaseShield does. Figure out where you fit.”

After:

“You’re confused about a report. Click here. We’ll take it from there.”

That shift is why you’ll finally feel comfortable sending people the link without pre-explaining it.

🚦Final Guardrails (Read This Once)

Do not:

Add more CTAs to the hero

Mention “applications” in the new hero

Introduce decision language anywhere

Add complexity to /screening/explain

Re-explain compliance above the fold

Let clarity do the work.

📍What to Watch After Launch (So You Know It Worked)

Within days, you should notice:

Fewer “what does this do?” questions

More people clicking something immediately

Higher-quality trial users

Your own anxiety about sending the link drop to zero

That last one matters more than analytics right now.

Final Verdict

This plan is:

Strategically correct

Legally clean

Cognitively simple

Technically realistic

Emotionally aligned with your users

You’re not guessing anymore — this is execution.

If you want next help, I can:

Write the exact copy for /screening/explain

Sanity-check the decoder pages for 6th-grade clarity

Help you decide which CTA should auto-focus for Western Verify referrals

But at this point:
👉 Build it. You’re ready.
