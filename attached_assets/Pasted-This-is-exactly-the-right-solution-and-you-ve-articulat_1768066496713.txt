This is exactly the right solution — and you’ve articulated it in a way that shows product maturity, not just AI output polish.

Short answer: Yes, do this.
Long answer: here’s how to execute it so it feels intentional, compliant, and premium (not like “AI wrote a lot of text”).

✅ Why this works (and why it’s safe)

What you’re proposing hits all three hard constraints:

Doesn’t make decisions

Improves compliance

Respects landlord time

Progressive disclosure is the correct UX pattern here because:

Most landlords want a quick answer

Some want defensible reasoning

A few want deep compliance support

You’re letting them choose the depth — that’s the line between “advisor” and “decider.”

🔹 Recommended final structure (tightened slightly)
🔝 Always visible (above the fold)
1) Plain-English explanation

Keep it short (3–4 sentences max).

What this means
A charge-off occurs when a lender stops trying to collect a debt after missed payments. The balance is still owed and typically indicates past financial hardship.

2) Risk weighting (replace “Risk level: MEDIUM/HIGH”)

This is a great move.

Example:

How landlords typically weigh this
• Higher weight if recent (last 24 months)
• Higher weight if multiple charge-offs exist
• Lower weight if older or medical-related

This avoids judgment language while still being useful.

3) “What this does NOT mean”

This is critical — don’t bury it.

What this does NOT automatically mean
• It does not guarantee missed rent
• It does not require denial
• Context matters (timing, type, recovery since)

This single section dramatically reduces misuse risk.

🔽 Collapsible sections (accordion — collapsed by default)
▸ Common Screening Responses

Rename slightly for neutrality:

Common screening approaches used by landlords

Content framed descriptively:

Some landlords require higher income ratios

Some allow co-signers to offset risk

Some focus more heavily on rental history than credit alone

No “should,” no “recommend.”

▸ Consistency Check (Fair Housing)

This is one of your strongest features — keep it opt-in.

Consistency check (Fair Housing)
Before relying on this information, confirm:
• This factor is addressed in your written criteria
• You apply the same standards to all applicants
• Any exceptions are documented consistently

Optional CTA inside accordion:

Want help checking your criteria? Paste it here.

▸ Documentation Helper

This is premium value without liability.

Neutral documentation language (optional)
“Application reviewed using standard screening criteria. Credit report reflects a charge-off dated [MM/YYYY]. Applicant was evaluated using the same criteria applied to all applicants.”

This protects them either way.

▸ Questions to Ask the Applicant

Keep this — it’s excellent.

Minor tweak:

Label as “Optional follow-up questions”

Reinforces that they don’t have to interrogate applicants

🔹 Always visible (bottom, muted)

This explanation is informational only and does not direct approval or denial decisions. Final screening decisions should be based on your written criteria and applied consistently.

Keep it subtle. Don’t legal-ese it.

🧠 Product polish suggestions (small but impactful)
1) Use iconography to signal intent

ℹ️ Explanation

⚖️ Consistency

📝 Documentation

👥 Common practices

This helps users mentally separate information from action.

2) Save expansion state per user

Advanced users will expand the same sections every time. Remember their preferences.

3) Add “Why this matters” micro-tooltips

Tiny hover text explaining why consistency or documentation matters reinforces compliance without preaching.

🚫 What NOT to add (you’re right to avoid these)

❌ “Approve / Deny” suggestions

❌ Numeric approval thresholds

❌ Auto-generated decisions

❌ “We recommend…” language

You’ve stayed on the correct side of that line.

Final verdict

This is the correct design.
It:

Increases value

Reduces misuse

Improves compliance defensibility

Feels premium and intentional

Scales across every decoder item (credit, criminal, eviction)
