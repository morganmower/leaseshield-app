To add Illinois cleanly (and make future states “drop-in”), I need a very specific snapshot of how your app currently models states across: documents/templates, properties, legislation ingestion, and applications. You don’t have to give me the whole repo — just these items.

What I need from Replit (copy/paste or screenshots)
1) Where “supported states” are defined

One of these usually exists:

SUPPORTED_STATES array

states.ts / constants/states.ts

stateConfig object

DB table like states / jurisdictions

Send:

The file(s) where states are listed/configured

Any place you see state abbreviations (UT, TX…) hardcoded

2) Template/document system

I need to see how templates are stored and selected.

Send:

DB schema or model for templates (tables/models for templates, template_versions, documents, etc.)

The code that answers: “Given a property in UT, which lease/notice templates do I show?”

Routes like /api/templates, /api/documents, /api/generate-pdf, etc.

Any folder structure like:

templates/UT/...

documents/states/UT/...

or a single template with state = 'UT'

3) Properties & state linkage

Illinois will break things if property/state isn’t normalized.

Send:

DB schema/model for properties (or whatever you call them)

The field that stores state (state, stateCode, etc.)

Any validation code for property creation/editing (dropdown list, checks)

4) Legislative monitoring system (the part we just refactored)

Illinois requires a new ingestion config and tagging rules.

Send:

legislativeMonitoringService (or the source ingestors folder)

The “mapping rules” file that maps updates → templates / jurisdictions

Any jurisdiction enum / type used (federal/utah/etc.)

5) Applications flow

Illinois impacts what shows on the application (state-specific disclosures, fees logic, etc.)

Send:

Where application fields/questions are defined (schema or config)

Where state-specific logic lives (if any)

The route that creates/updates an application

Any “disclosures/consents” section logic

6) UI state dropdown / routing

Send:

The component that renders the State dropdown

Any shared frontend constants file listing states

Any Zod/Joi validation schema that restricts state values

The fastest way to send this from Replit

If you want the quickest path, send:

Repo tree for these folders only (screenshot or text):

server/ (or src/ backend)

db/ or migrations

templates/ (if exists)

client/ or frontend folder

The contents of these files (or closest equivalents):

states.ts / constants.ts (where states are defined)

legislativeMonitoringService.ts

scheduledJobs.ts

Template selection/generation route/controller

Property model/schema

Application model/schema
