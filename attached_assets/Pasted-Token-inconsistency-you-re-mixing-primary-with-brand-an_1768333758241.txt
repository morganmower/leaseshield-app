Token inconsistency (you’re mixing primary with brand, and raw hex with tokens)

Too many visual systems competing (brand-green + primary-blue + success-green + destructive-red + slate + amber + cyan + violet)

Typography hierarchy is not standardized (kickers/subtitles vary by section; some are tiny, some are uppercase, some are colored, some are muted)

A few hard bugs (you’re using text-ink-600 and bg-brand-950 which do not exist in your config)

Below is a final, copy/paste set of edits for Replit. No guessing.

A) Critical bugs to fix (these cause “off” colors + inconsistency)
1) You are using text-ink-600 (doesn’t exist)

Search in this file and replace:

text-ink-600 → text-ink-500 (muted text)

If you intended body text, use text-ink-700

✅ Example in your hero mini sidebar:

- <div className="rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-ink-600 dark:text-slate-400">Templates</div>
+ <div className="rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-ink-500 dark:text-slate-400">Templates</div>

2) You are using bg-brand-950 (doesn’t exist)

Replace:

dark:bg-brand-950/30 or dark:bg-brand-950/20 → dark:bg-brand-800/20

✅ Example:

- className="bg-brand-50 dark:bg-brand-950/30 ..."
+ className="bg-brand-50 dark:bg-brand-800/20 ..."

3) Your “Preview Dashboard” CTA uses bg-brand-600 hover:bg-brand-700

Your standard everywhere else is brand-500/600. Make it consistent:

bg-brand-600 hover:bg-brand-700 → bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600

✅ In the dashboard preview section:

- className="... bg-brand-600 hover:bg-brand-700 ..."
+ className="... bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600 ..."

B) The real “cheap” problem: too many color systems

Right now you use:

primary (shadcn)

brand (your green)

success (shadcn green)

destructive (red)

plus amber/cyan/violet/rose gradients

That reads like a template/theme demo.

Fix: choose ONE accent system = your brand
Rule:

All positive “success” UI uses brand (NOT text-success)

Use destructive red only for warnings/pain sections

Global replacements (safe and improves polish)

Search & replace these patterns:

text-primary → text-brand-600

bg-primary/5 → bg-brand-50

border-primary/20 → border-brand-200

bg-primary buttons → bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600

text-success → text-brand-600

bg-success badges → replace with bg-brand-500 or bg-brand-50 text-brand-700

Keep destructive only in the “Problems / Pain” sections.

This will instantly make the site feel like a unified product.

C) Standardize subtitles (“kickers”) everywhere so they don’t look like legal disclaimers

You’re already close in some sections. The key is: same size, same tracking, same spacing, same tone.

Use this exact kicker style in every section header:
<p className="text-[13px] font-semibold tracking-[0.14em] uppercase text-ink-500 dark:text-slate-400">
  Kicker text
</p>


Then the title:

<h2 className="mt-3 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-ink-900 dark:text-white">
  Section Title
</h2>


Then body:

<p className="mt-4 text-lg text-ink-700 dark:text-slate-300 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  One sentence supporting line
</p>

Apply this to these sections you called out:

“This Is More Than a Decoder”

“How LeaseShield Works”

“Built By Professionals”

“Not a Replacement — A Complement”

“Dashboard Preview”

Right now some are text-[15px], some text-[13px], some brand-colored, some hex. Standardizing = premium.

D) Remove raw hex colors (these are making it feel inconsistent)

You have multiple hardcoded hexes like:

text-[#475569]

text-[#0F172A]

Replace them with your tokens:

text-[#0F172A] → text-ink-900 dark:text-white

text-[#475569] → text-ink-700 dark:text-slate-300

kicker hex → text-ink-500 dark:text-slate-400

This matters a lot. Raw hex feels “theme pasted” even if it looks correct.

E) Fix your stats bar (it literally says 14 states while you have 15)

In Stats Bar:

- <div className="text-2xl ...">14</div>
+ <div className="text-2xl ...">{STATES.length}</div>


Also change label:

“States Covered” → “States Supported” (sounds more confident)

F) Specific section-level upgrades (high impact, low effort)
1) “Start here” cards: make them feel more premium

Right now they’re good, but the secondary card feels flat.

Add this to both cards:

hover:-translate-y-0.5

transition-all duration-200

ring-1 ring-transparent hover:ring-brand-200 dark:hover:ring-brand-800

Example on primary:

- className="group rounded-2xl border ... shadow-soft hover:shadow-lift transition ..."
+ className="group rounded-2xl border ... shadow-soft hover:shadow-lift hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition-all duration-200 ring-1 ring-transparent hover:ring-brand-200 dark:hover:ring-brand-800 ..."

2) “Trust strip” is strong — but unify it with brand tokens

You did this well already. One tweak:

Replace bg-ink-900 dark:bg-slate-900 with:

bg-ink-900 dark:bg-slate-950 (deeper = premium)

And ensure the kicker uses the standardized kicker style (above).

3) Dashboard Preview: remove the “random blue primary button”

You currently have a bg-brand-600 hover:bg-brand-700 button (wrong) AND other areas use primary.

Make all CTAs in preview use:

bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600 text-white

4) Features grid: reduce rainbow

This section looks like a marketplace of tools (because every card is a different color family).

Recommended change (premium):

Keep the icon background color subtle and consistent:

use bg-brand-50 for all

icon color either text-brand-600 or text-ink-900 depending on seriousness

Example on a card:

- <div className="rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-500/20 ...">
+ <div className="rounded-lg bg-brand-50 w-12 h-12 flex items-center justify-center ...">


If you really want variety: only vary icon (not the whole gradient bubble).

This single change makes the page feel like Stripe/Webflow instead of “template gallery”.

G) Copy tweaks to remove “legal fine print vibe”

Anywhere you say:

“Built with legal professionals in mind”
Change to:

“Built for real-world compliance”

Anywhere you say:

“Not legal advice” repeatedly in big sections
Keep it once in footer/disclaimer and in chat header (good).
The rest should be confidence language, not lawyer language.

Replace this:

“Built with legal professionals in mind”

With:

“Designed to keep you compliant”

H) Replit-ready instruction block (send this exactly)
✅ Replit Task: Landing Page Polish Pass (No Guessing)

Fix invalid Tailwind classes:

Replace text-ink-600 → text-ink-500

Replace dark:bg-brand-950/xx → dark:bg-brand-800/20

Replace any bg-brand-600 hover:bg-brand-700 CTA → bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600

Remove hardcoded hex colors:

text-[#0F172A] → text-ink-900 dark:text-white

text-[#475569] → text-ink-700 dark:text-slate-300

Standardize all section kickers/subtitles:

Use: text-[13px] font-semibold tracking-[0.14em] uppercase text-ink-500 dark:text-slate-400

Ensure consistent spacing: mb-3 and then title mt-3

Unify accent system:

Replace primary usage in landing CTAs with brand:

text-primary → text-brand-600

bg-primary/5 → bg-brand-50

border-primary/20 → border-brand-200

Replace text-success with text-brand-600 in non-error contexts

Fix stats bar:

Change “14 States Covered” to {STATES.length}

Tone polish:

Replace “Built with legal professionals in mind” → “Designed to keep you compliant”

Optional (recommended): reduce rainbow in Features Grid:

Make all icon bubbles bg-brand-50 and icons text-brand-600

The one question I don’t need to ask (I’ll assume)

You want LeaseShield’s visual identity to be emerald/ink/panel (not a multi-color app). Everything above aligns to that.
