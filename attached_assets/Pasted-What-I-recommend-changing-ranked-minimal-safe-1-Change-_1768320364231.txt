What I recommend changing (ranked, minimal, safe)
🔹 1. Change the header to sound like help, not a tool

This is the single biggest win.

Current:

Credit Report AI Helper
Describe what you see or type a term – get instant explanation

Replace with:

Understand Your Credit Report in Plain English
Paste or describe any part of the report you’re unsure about — LeaseShield will explain what it means and flag compliance risks.

Why:

Removes “AI tool” vibes

Matches the landing page promise

Reassures instead of instructs

🔹 2. Make the input box more directive (this matters a lot)

Current placeholder:

Example: “Applicant has a charge-off from 2022…”

Replace with something more explicit:

Type or paste anything confusing from the report here (e.g., “Charge-off from 2022” or “3 collections totaling $2,400”).

This answers the silent question:

“What exactly do you want from me?”

🔹 3. Rename the button to an outcome, not a mechanism

Current:

Get AI Explanation

Better options (pick one):

Explain What This Means ← best

Get Plain-English Explanation

Explain This for Me

Avoid “AI” in the button. Users don’t care how—they care what.

🔹 4. Promote the examples (low effort, high payoff)

Your “Try asking” examples are excellent. Make them feel like a shortcut, not reading material.

Two easy upgrades:

Slightly larger font

Make them clickable → auto-populate the input box

This creates the feeling:

“Oh—I can just click one of these.”

That’s a huge confidence boost for non-tech users.

🔹 5. Optional but very strong: quick-start buttons

Only do this if it’s easy.

Add 3–4 tappable chips or buttons under the examples:

Charge-off or collection?

Low credit score?

Late payments?

High balances?

Clicking one just fills the input with a template question.

This removes all “what do I type?” anxiety.

What I would NOT change (important)

Do not:

Add uploads here

Add a wizard

Add more fields

Add onboarding popups

Add heavy visual effects

Make the privacy warning scarier (yellow is fine; red may spike anxiety)

The simplicity is a strength.
