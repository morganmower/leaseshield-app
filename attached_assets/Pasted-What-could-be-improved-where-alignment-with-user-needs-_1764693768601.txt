What could be improved — where alignment with user needs / conversion-optimization can be strengthened

Based on your survey results + general SaaS landing page best practices, there are a few gaps or mismatches that might be limiting your conversions.

1. Feature messaging doesn’t fully match your primary audience’s pain-points

The bullet list under “Everything included” is decent, but the language tends toward generic SaaS jargon: e.g., “compliance monitoring,” “tenant issue workflows,” “document assembly wizard,” “AI credit report decoder.”

From your survey data, landlords are looking for very specific tools — state-specific leases & notices, move-in/move-out checklists, adverse-action letters, screening checklists, legal/regulation updates, credit-report interpretation help.

Because your copy doesn’t echo the precise phrasing landlords used, you’re missing the “that’s exactly what I need” trigger. Best practice says landing pages should speak directly to user pain with clear value prop & benefits.

Recommendation: Revise the feature list to match survey-language, call out those high-value items by name, and lead with them.

2. The page lacks strong benefit-driven copy & urgency/context

Right now it mostly lists features. Good — but features don’t sell; benefits do. That means you need copy that hits the landlord’s pain: “stop wasting hours searching for correct forms,” “avoid costly compliance mistakes,” “make tenant screening simple and legally safe,” etc.

Customers often convert when they feel a problem solved, not just when they see a list of features. That’s a common principle in high-converting SaaS pages: make the value prop clear before you load the features.

Recommendation: Add a short “Why this matters” / “What you gain” section near the top or near the pricing block.

3. Missing some of the survey-backed core items from the “included” feature list

I don’t see explicit mention of move-in / move-out checklists, state-specific legal notices, adverse action letters / screening-rejection legal letters, or ongoing legal/regulation updates.

These are high-value items for landlords (based on survey feedback). Omitting them underplays a key differentiator compared to generic template libraries or basic SaaS.

Recommendation: Add those missing items into the included-feature list — or at least call them out somewhere on the page, ideally prominently.

🎯 My Verdict: The Site Looks Good — but it has “Upgrade Potential”

Yes — your site is solid and well on its way to being a high-converting SaaS landing page. It’s clean, simple, and provides a straightforward offer.

But: it’s not yet maximizing its potential because it doesn’t fully speak the language of your prospective customers (small landlords) or emphasize the highest-value pain-killer features that came out of your survey.

So what you’ve built is a good MVP landing page, but with a few tweaks you could make it a great converting page.

✅ What I’d Do If I Were You (Next Steps)

If I were you, I’d:

Rewrite the feature list to reflect exact survey-language (leases, notices, checklists, screening letters, legal updates, etc.)

Add a “benefits / pain relief” sub-header or short paragraph above the pricing block (why this matters)

Maybe include a small “sample screenshot / sample doc” or “see what a ready-to-use lease looks like” — that builds trust and reduces perceived risk.

Keep testing: once you have traffic, watch conversion rates and adjust copy based on what works (headline, CTA, feature list) — best practices suggest optimization done via iterative testing.
