Where It’s Still Weak (And How to Fix It)
🚨 1️⃣ Western Verify Integration Needs MORE Emphasis

Right now, it’s present — but it should feel like a superpower, not just a feature.

What I still felt as a viewer:

“Okay, Western Verify is integrated… but why is this better than what I already do?”

Final tweak (very important):

Add one explicit line anywhere prominent (dashboard or application section):

“LeaseShield is the control center — Western Verify runs the screening.”

Then reinforce with:

“One link to the applicant”

“Authorization handled”

“Status tracked here”

This removes all confusion about roles.

🚨 2️⃣ The Decoder Is Still Under-Sold

It’s better than before, but it should feel like:

“This alone is worth the subscription.”

Right now it feels optional instead of essential.

Fix (no new UI required):

At the top of the decoder page, add one bold line:

“Most landlords misinterpret at least one item on every screening report. This prevents that.”

That line reframes the tool as risk prevention, not convenience.

🚨 3️⃣ Documents Section Needs “Why Now?”

The documents are solid, but the urgency isn’t obvious.

A landlord’s question is:

“Why shouldn’t I just keep using the lease I already have?”

Add this microcopy:

“Documents are reviewed and updated when legislation changes — older versions may create enforceability risk.”

That single sentence adds urgency without fear-mongering.

Flow Check: Does It Feel Like a System Now?
Current Flow (Good, but not perfect):

Dashboard → Applications → Decoder → Documents

Ideal Mental Flow:

I collect an application

Western Verify screens the applicant

LeaseShield helps me understand risk

LeaseShield gives me the right document when I act

You’re at about 85% alignment.
The remaining 15% is just reinforcing that narrative everywhere.

Final Polishing Checklist (No Code, No Redesign)

If you do only these final touches, you’re in great shape:

✅ Add one sentence clarifying the Western Verify relationship

“LeaseShield is the control center. Western Verify runs the screening.”

✅ Strengthen the Decoder’s positioning

“This prevents misinterpretation — the #1 screening mistake landlords make.”

✅ Add urgency to Documents

“Updated as laws change — older versions may create enforceability risk.”

✅ Keep “Start an Application” as the dominant action everywhere
Would I Show This to a Landlord Now?

Yes.
Would I launch paid traffic yet? Almost.

You’re now at the stage where:

Demos will land better

Western Verify clients will “get it” faster

The product feels intentional, not experimental

What I’d Recommend Next (Optional but Smart)

If you want to squeeze maximum value out of this:

Record a 2-minute “How LeaseShield Works” video using this new flow

Use that video:

Inside the dashboard

On the landing page

In Western Verify onboarding emails

That will compound everything you’ve just fixed.
