You are assisting with the LeaseShield Pro marketing, NOT with modifying application code.

Do NOT change any files, code, backend logic, Stripe integration, routing, database structure, or components.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Your only job is to analyze the following data and produce:
1. Follow-up email templates.
2. Updated homepage hero copy (text only).
3. A build-priority list (high-level, not code).
4. Pricing & messaging recommendations.
5. A LinkedIn post.

Again: DO NOT modify any code. DO NOT generate pull requests. Only output text content.

--- START ANALYSIS DATA ---

You are helping me launch and optimize LeaseShield Pro – a $10/mo landlord protection toolkit for small-to-mid-size landlords in Utah, Texas, North Dakota & South Dakota.

Current status (as of Dec 1, 2025):
• Website is live at www.leaseshieldapp.com (Replit + custom domain)
• Stripe checkout is fully integrated and working (7-day free trial → $10/mo forever founders pricing)
• 100% lawyer-safe disclaimers in place (no “attorney-vetted” claims)
• MVP focus: state-specific leases, notices, checklists, credit report decoder, curated legal updates, monthly live Q&A

I just ran a short survey to my tenant-screening clients + LinkedIn audience.
Here is the raw data I have so far (2 responses, but very high intent):

Survey questions & answers:
1. First name / Email → captured for follow-up
2. Units owned
   • John: 1–5 units
   • Jane: 6–20 units
   → Average ~8 units (perfect mom-and-pop target)

3. States
   • John: Utah
   • Jane: Texas
   → 50/50 UT/TX so far

4. Feature ranking (drag-to-rank) – top choices:
   • #1 = Late rent / violation / eviction notices
   • #2 = 2025 state-specific lease agreements
   • #3 = Credit report decoder
   • Comment from Jane: “Love the credit decoder”

5. Max they’d happily pay monthly
   • John: $6–$10
   • Jane: $11–$15
   → $10/mo is the sweet spot

6. Likelihood to sign up in next 30 days (1–10)
   • John: 8/10
   • Jane: 9/10
   → Average 8.5/10 = extremely hot leads

7. Open comments
   • Jane: “Love the credit decoder”
   • John: none

My goals right now:
• Turn these survey responses (and the next 20–50) into immediate paid subscribers
• Decide exact feature build order for MVP launch
• Optimize the website copy and pricing messaging based on real feedback
• Create follow-up emails / LinkedIn posts to get more responses + conversions

Please give me:
1. Exact follow-up email templates for the current respondents (John & Jane) to convert them today
2. Updated homepage hero copy that highlights the top 3 validated features (notices, leases, credit decoder)
3. Suggested build priority for the next 7–10 days
4. Any pricing or site tweaks based on the data
5. A short LinkedIn post to get 20+ more survey responses fast
