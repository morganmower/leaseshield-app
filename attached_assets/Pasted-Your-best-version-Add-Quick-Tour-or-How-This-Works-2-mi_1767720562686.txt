Your best version

✔ Add “Quick Tour” or “How This Works (2 min)”
✔ Place it top-right, secondary style, not primary
✔ Optional, dismissible, never forced

Exact wording recommendation:

Quick Tour (2 min)

That feels respectful, not patronizing.

2️⃣ “Make the Add Property button even bigger/brighter (green)”

Verdict: ⚠️ Caution — color choice matters

Why this is tricky

Green = “go / success” in consumer apps
But in legal/compliance software, green can:

Feel casual

Reduce seriousness

Conflict with your calm, trust-first tone

What I recommend instead

✔ Keep your primary action dominant, but:

Use your brand accent color, not green

Increase size and weight, not brightness

Add microcopy under it

Example microcopy under button:

Required to run applications and documents

That increases clicks without changing color psychology.

3️⃣ “On empty states, add a big friendly Get Started card”

Verdict: ✅ 100% yes — this is the strongest suggestion

This is high-impact and very low risk.

Empty states are where users get stuck.

What to add

When there are:

No properties

No applications

No documents saved

Show a card that says:

Get Started
Add your first property to send applications, run screening through Western Verify, and access state-specific documents.

Button:

Add Your First Property

This dramatically improves activation.

4️⃣ “Add simple tooltips for each main card”

Verdict: ⚠️ Yes — but limit to ONE sentence

Tooltips are good if they:

Explain why, not how

Are optional

Don’t clutter

Example tooltip text (perfect length)

Applications:

Send one link. Screening runs through Western Verify.

Decoder:

Prevents misinterpretation of screening reports.

Documents:

Updated when legislation changes.

No more than that.

5️⃣ “Slight animation on button clicks”

Verdict: ✅ Yes, subtle is good

This is pure UX feedback and won’t harm trust.

Guidelines

✔ Micro-interactions only
✔ No bounce, no flashy motion
✔ Just a press / fade / ripple

This improves perceived quality without “SaaS-ifying” the app.

Final Recommendation: What to Actually Implement
✅ Implement Now (High ROI, Low Risk)

Empty-state “Get Started” cards

One-sentence tooltips on main cards

Subtle button press feedback

⚠️ Implement Carefully

“Quick Tour (2 min)” — secondary, optional

Make primary actions more dominant without turning them green

❌ Skip

Forced walkthroughs

Overly bright colors

Multi-step tours that interrupt flow
