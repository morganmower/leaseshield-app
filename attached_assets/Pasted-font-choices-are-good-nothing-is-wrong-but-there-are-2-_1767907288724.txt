font choices are good — nothing is wrong — but there are 2 very small hierarchy tweaks that would noticeably improve readability and perceived polish.

You’re at the “refinement” stage, not redesign.

What’s Working Well (Don’t Change)

✅ Typeface itself (clean, modern, SaaS-appropriate)
✅ Consistent font family across the section
✅ Calm, professional tone (fits compliance product)
✅ Good contrast between headings and body text
✅ Spacing is already solid

So no need to swap fonts or introduce new ones.

The Real Issue (Subtle Hierarchy, Not Font Choice)

Right now, everything feels slightly too similar in weight, which causes:

Step titles

Step descriptions

Clarifying lines

Trust + association blocks

to visually compete with each other.

The eye should clearly know:

What to read first

What is supporting detail

What is reassurance / optional context

✅ Recommended Micro-Typography Tweaks (Very Light)
1️⃣ Make Step Titles Slightly Stronger

Current:
Step titles are bold, but close to body weight.

Recommendation:

Increase font-weight one notch (e.g., from 500 → 600)

Or increase font-size by ~2px

Result:
The eye locks onto the steps instantly, improving scan speed.

Example:

Collect Applications & Screen Tenants ← feels more decisive

2️⃣ De-Emphasize the Clarifying Gray Lines Just a Touch More

These two lines are correct content-wise — they just need to feel more “supporting.”

Lines like:

“LeaseShield connects to your screening provider…”

“Documents update automatically as laws change…”

Recommendation:

Reduce font-size slightly (e.g., 0.85–0.9em)

Keep gray color, but slightly lighter if possible

Result:
They read as reassurance, not core instruction — exactly what you want.

3️⃣ Separate Trust Signal vs. Association Block More Clearly

This is the one place I’d adjust spacing, not font.

Right now:

“Built by professionals…”

“Designed to complement your apartment association…”

are close enough that they can feel like one block.

Recommendation:

Add a little more vertical spacing between them

OR slightly reduce the font size of the association block

Why:

Trust signal = credibility

Association clarification = objection handling

They serve different psychological jobs and should feel distinct.

❌ What I Would NOT Change

Do not:

Introduce a second font

Use italics for emphasis

Increase contrast aggressively

Make association text too bold

Turn this into a “callout box”

It should remain calm and confident.

Final Verdict

Do fonts need to change?
👉 No. Typeface is right.

Do hierarchy and emphasis need light tuning?
👉 Yes — small weight/size adjustments will improve clarity and polish.

If I had to summarize in one sentence:

Your typography is correct; it just needs slightly clearer visual leadership.
