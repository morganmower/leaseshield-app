ou fixed the messaging correctly.
You did not yet fix the visual authority.

Right now the page still feels:

fragmented

section-heavy

visually flat

too many “headline-like things” competing

not enough hero moments anchoring the scroll

Nothing is wrong — but nothing feels deliberate or premium yet.

This is why your gut says “this looks cheap / legal / boring.”

You’re right.

CORE ISSUE (THE ROOT CAUSE)

You currently have too many sections styled at the same visual weight.

Your eye doesn’t know:

what matters most

where to pause

where confidence lives

Everything is centered, white, text-first, and evenly spaced.

That creates a terms-and-conditions vibe, even with good copy.

FIX THIS WITH A CLEAR VISUAL PYRAMID

You need 4 visual tiers, not 12 “sections.”

Visual Tier System (use this everywhere)
Tier	Purpose	Size	Background
Tier 1	Core action	Huge	White / gradient
Tier 2	System explanation	Large	Light gray
Tier 3	Trust & credibility	Medium	Soft contrast
Tier 4	Supporting info	Small	White

Right now everything is Tier 2–3.

SECTION-BY-SECTION FIXES (VERY SPECIFIC)
1️⃣ “What would you like help with right now?” (START HERE)
What’s wrong

Cards are too small

No dominant focal point

CTA looks optional

Reads like a settings screen

What to do
Make this a PRIMARY HERO SECTION, not a sub-section

Change layout to:

Full-width container

Light gradient background (very subtle)

Cards at least 420–460px tall

Left card visually dominant

Exact visual changes

Left card:

Background: soft green tint

Border: none

Shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(16,185,129,0.18)

Icon size: 48–56px

Title size: 22px

CTA button INSIDE card (large)

Right card:

White background

Subtle border

Smaller shadow

No button — arrow only

Copy tweak (small but powerful)

Replace:

“Most landlords start by explaining an existing screening report.”

With:

“Most landlords start here.”

Short. Confident. No hedging.

2️⃣ “Beyond Screening” (THIS IS STILL WEAK)

You are correct — this section still doesn’t work.

Why

The image is doing all the work

The text above it feels disconnected

“Beyond Screening” is too small and passive

Fix: Turn this into a Transition Section

This is not a feature section.
It’s a bridge.

Replace the structure with:

Eyebrow

THIS IS MORE THAN A DECODER


Main headline

LeaseShield Is a Complete Landlord Protection System


Supporting line

Screening interpretation is just the starting point.


Then place the image beside the text (not below).

Two-column layout:

Left: text

Right: image

This gives the image context and authority.

3️⃣ “How LeaseShield Works” (ALMOST THERE)

This is much better — but still too flat.

What’s wrong

All steps look equal

No visual rhythm

Too text-heavy vertically

Fix

Turn this into horizontal step cards.

Each step:

Icon in circle

Title bold

One-line description

Optional helper line smaller

Add:

A thin horizontal connector line

More white space between steps

This will remove the “instruction manual” feel.

4️⃣ “Built by Screening & Compliance Professionals”
This should NOT be a standalone section

It feels floating and random.

Fix: Merge it into a Trust Band

Place it between How It Works and Association section.

Style:

Light gray background

Icons (shield / scale / check)

2–3 short credibility statements

Example:

Decades of screening experience

Built alongside compliance professionals

Designed for real landlord decisions

This turns it from “legal copy” into confidence reinforcement.

5️⃣ “Designed to Work Alongside Your Apartment Association”

This copy is good.
The placement is wrong.

What’s wrong

Feels like a disclaimer

Too text-only

Too late in the scroll

Fix

Make it a comparison explainer, not a statement.

New layout

Two-column comparison:

Left

Apartment Associations
• Education
• Advocacy
• Annual templates


Right

LeaseShield
• Day-to-day decisions
• Screening interpretation
• Live compliance tools


Then your existing closing line underneath.

This instantly answers the survey objection visually, not verbally.

GLOBAL DESIGN CHANGES YOU SHOULD MAKE NOW
Fonts

Headings: Inter / 600–700

Body: Inter / 400

Eyebrows: Inter / 600 / letter-spaced

Font sizing rules (do not break these)

Hero headline: 44–52px

Color usage

FINAL HONEST TAKE

You were right to feel uncomfortable.

The product story is now excellent.
The visual story is still catching up.

Once you:

reduce the number of “sections”

increase hierarchy contrast

let key moments breathe

stop centering everything

This will feel:

premium

confident

intentional

worth paying for
